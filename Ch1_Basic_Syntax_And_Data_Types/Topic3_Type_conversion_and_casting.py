# ========================================
# 1. Overview and Historical Context
# ---------------------------------
"""
Type conversion and casting in Python refer to the process of changing an object's data type.
These concepts are fundamental to Python's dynamic typing system and play a crucial role in
data manipulation and interoperability between different parts of a program.

Historical Context:
- Python has supported type conversion since its inception in 1991.
- Python 2 had separate functions for integer division ('/') and true division ('//').
- Python 3 unified division under '/' and introduced '//' for floor division.
- Type hints were introduced in Python 3.5 (PEP 484) to support static type checking.

In modern software development, understanding type conversion is crucial for:
- Data processing and analysis
- Interfacing with external systems and APIs
- Optimizing performance in critical code sections
- Ensuring type safety in large-scale applications

Compared to other languages:
- Python's dynamic typing allows for more flexible type conversion than statically-typed languages like Java or C++.
- Python's type conversion is generally more implicit than in languages like C, where explicit casting is often required.
- Python's 'duck typing' philosophy means that explicit type conversion is often unnecessary in day-to-day coding.

# ========================================

# Importing necessary modules
import sys  # Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions (e.g., sys.version for Python version)
import time  # Standard library for time-related functions, e.g., time.sleep(), time.time()
import timeit  # Used for measuring execution time, useful for performance testing and optimization
from typing import Any, Union, List, Dict, Tuple  # Type hinting utilities that enhance code readability and maintainability
from decimal import Decimal  # Provides support for precise decimal floating-point arithmetic
from fractions import Fraction  # Facilitates rational number arithmetic, allowing exact representations of fractions

# ========================================
# Explanation and Insights
# ---------------------------------
# 1. `timeit` is ideal for benchmarking small code snippets to determine their performance, 
#    often more accurate than `time.time()` due to its repeatability and precision.
# 2. `typing` module (e.g., Union, List, Dict, Tuple) enables static type checking, which is beneficial in larger projects
#    for catching type-related errors early in the development process.
# 3. `Decimal` is invaluable when precision is crucial, such as in financial applications where floating-point 
#    rounding errors are unacceptable.
# 4. `Fraction` is underutilized but highly effective for tasks requiring exact fractional representation, 
#    such as probability calculations or ratio-based computations.

    # Integer to Float Conversion
    int_num = 10  # An integer value
    float_num = float(int_num)  # Converts the integer to a floating-point number
    print(f"Integer {int_num} to Float: {float_num}")
    # Note: This conversion is straightforward, as any integer can be precisely represented as a float.
    
    # Float to Integer Conversion (truncation occurs)
    float_num = 10.8  # A floating-point value
    int_num = int(float_num)  # Converts to integer; the fractional part is discarded (not rounded)
    print(f"Float {float_num} to Integer: {int_num}")
    # Pitfall: Be aware that this conversion always truncates towards zero, which may not be intuitive.
    # Advanced Tip: Use `round()` if rounding behavior is desired, e.g., `int(round(float_num))`.

    # String to Integer Conversion
    str_num = "100"  # A string representing an integer
    int_num = int(str_num)  # Converts the string to an integer
    print(f"String '{str_num}' to Integer: {int_num}")
    # Best Practice: Always validate or sanitize input strings to avoid `ValueError` exceptions if the string isn't numeric.

    # Integer to String Conversion
    int_num = 200  # An integer value
    str_num = str(int_num)  # Converts the integer to a string
    print(f"Integer {int_num} to String: '{str_num}'")
    # Use Case: This conversion is common when concatenating integers with other strings in formatted messages.

    # String to Float Conversion
    str_num = "3.14"  # A string representing a float
    float_num = float(str_num)  # Converts the string to a floating-point number
    print(f"String '{str_num}' to Float: {float_num}")
    # Advanced Tip: When dealing with locales where different decimal separators are used (e.g., ',' vs '.'), 
    # this conversion might need additional handling to ensure correct parsing.

    # Boolean to Integer Conversion
    bool_val = True  # A boolean value
    int_num = int(bool_val)  # Converts `True` to 1 and `False` to 0
    print(f"Boolean {bool_val} to Integer: {int_num}")
    # Insight: This conversion allows for efficient conditional calculations, such as using booleans in arithmetic expressions.
    # Example: `total = base + is_discount_applicable * discount_amount`

    # List to Tuple Conversion
    list_example = [1, 2, 3]  # A list of integers
    tuple_example = tuple(list_example)  # Converts the list to a tuple
    print(f"List {list_example} to Tuple: {tuple_example}")
    # Insight: Tuples are immutable, making them suitable for data that should not change, providing safer and more efficient access.
    
    # Tuple to List Conversion
    tuple_example = (4, 5, 6)  # A tuple of integers
    list_example = list(tuple_example)  # Converts the tuple to a list
    print(f"Tuple {tuple_example} to List: {list_example}")
    # Best Practice: Use this conversion when you need to modify data stored in a tuple, as lists are mutable.

    # String to List of Characters Conversion
    str_example = "Hello"  # A string
    list_chars = list(str_example)  # Converts the string to a list of individual characters
    print(f"String '{str_example}' to List of characters: {list_chars}")
    # Pitfall: This conversion creates a list of single-character strings. It might not be suitable for splitting words or phrases.

    # List of Integers to List of Strings Conversion
    int_list = [1, 2, 3]  # A list of integers
    str_list = list(map(str, int_list))  # Converts each integer to a string using `map`
    print(f"List of integers {int_list} to List of strings: {str_list}")
    # Advanced Tip: `map()` is often more efficient than list comprehensions for applying a single function across elements.
    # Equivalent list comprehension: `[str(i) for i in int_list]`

    # Dictionary Keys to List Conversion
    dict_example = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}  # A dictionary with string keys
    keys_list = list(dict_example.keys())  # Extracts keys as a list
    print(f"Dictionary keys to List: {keys_list}")
    # Insight: This is useful when you need to iterate over dictionary keys, and using a list allows for indexed access.
    
    # Set to List Conversion
    set_example = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1}  # A set with duplicate values (duplicates are removed automatically)
    list_from_set = list(set_example)  # Converts the set to a list
    print(f"Set {set_example} to List: {list_from_set}")
    # Pitfall: Sets are unordered, so converting back to a list might result in a different order than expected.
    # Advanced Tip: Use sets to efficiently remove duplicates from a list: `unique_list = list(set(original_list))`

# ========================================
# Function: implicit_type_conversion
# ---------------------------------
def implicit_type_conversion():
    """Demonstrates implicit type conversion (type coercion) in Python."""
    
    # Integer and Float in arithmetic operations
    result = 5 + 3.14  # Python implicitly converts the integer 5 to a float for compatibility
    print(f"5 + 3.14 = {result} (type: {type(result)})")
    # Explanation: The result is a float because Python uses the "wider" type (float) to preserve precision.
    # This is a form of "upcasting" to avoid data loss, a behavior common in dynamically typed languages.

    # String and Integer concatenation
    num = 42
    # Direct concatenation of a string and integer would cause a TypeError
    # The str() function is used for explicit type conversion to prevent this error
    message = "The answer is " + str(num)  # Explicit conversion required
    print(message)
    # Best Practice: Always use explicit type conversion when combining different data types to avoid unexpected behavior.

    # Boolean in arithmetic operations
    result = True + 1  # In Python, `True` is implicitly converted to 1 (similarly, `False` converts to 0)
    print(f"True + 1 = {result}")
    # Insight: Booleans are subclasses of integers (`issubclass(bool, int)` returns True), hence they participate in 
    # arithmetic operations seamlessly. This can be both a feature and a potential source of bugs if not properly understood.

# ========================================
# Function: type_checking
# ---------------------------------
def type_checking():
    """Demonstrates various methods of type checking in Python."""
    
    # Using type() function
    x = 5
    print(f"Type of x is: {type(x)}")
    # Explanation: `type()` returns the actual class/type of the object. Useful for debugging but rarely used for conditional checks.

    # Using isinstance() function
    y = "Hello"
    print(f"Is y a string? {isinstance(y, str)}")
    # Best Practice: Use `isinstance()` for type checking, as it's safer and supports inheritance checks.
    # `type(y) == str` would fail if `y` is an instance of a subclass of `str`.

    # Checking multiple types with isinstance()
    z = 3.14
    print(f"Is z a float or an integer? {isinstance(z, (float, int))}")
    # Advanced Tip: `isinstance()` can accept a tuple of types, making it efficient for checking against multiple types at once.
    # This is more pythonic and concise than using multiple logical OR (`or`) conditions.

# ========================================
# Function: custom_type_conversion
# ---------------------------------
def custom_type_conversion():
    """Demonstrates custom type conversion using magic methods (dunder methods)."""

    class Dollar:
        def __init__(self, amount):
            self.amount = amount  # `amount` represents the value in dollars, stored as a float

        def __str__(self):
            # The `__str__` method provides a human-readable string representation when the object is printed
            return f"${self.amount:.2f}"  # Format as a typical currency string with two decimal places
        
        def __int__(self):
            # The `__int__` method allows conversion to an integer, facilitating use in arithmetic and logical operations
            return int(self.amount)  # Caution: This conversion truncates the decimal part, not rounds it.

        def __float__(self):
            # The `__float__` method allows conversion to a float, ensuring seamless integration with floating-point operations
            return float(self.amount)

    # Creating an instance of Dollar
    money = Dollar(49.99)
    print(f"Dollar object: {money}")  # Uses the __str__ method implicitly
    print(f"As integer: {int(money)}")  # Uses the __int__ method for conversion to integer
    print(f"As float: {float(money)}")  # Uses the __float__ method for conversion to float

    # Advanced Insight: 
    # Implementing these magic methods (`__str__`, `__int__`, `__float__`) enhances interoperability with built-in functions 
    # and operations, allowing the custom class to behave like native data types. This is an example of Python's "duck typing" 
    # philosophy—if an object "quacks" like a float/int, Python treats it as such.

# ========================================
# Additional Considerations and Best Practices
# ---------------------------------
# 1. Be mindful of implicit conversions, especially when working with mixed data types. Although they often work seamlessly,
#    they can introduce subtle bugs, especially in complex calculations or data processing.
# 2. For custom type conversions, always implement the appropriate magic methods (`__int__`, `__float__`, `__str__`, etc.)
#    to provide clear, predictable behavior. This allows your objects to be used effectively in broader contexts (e.g., printing,
#    arithmetic operations, type casting).

# Potential Pitfalls:
# - Over-relying on implicit type conversion can lead to unexpected results, especially in complex expressions.
# - Mixing data types (e.g., adding an integer to a string without conversion) may cause TypeErrors, disrupting program execution.
# - Custom type conversion methods like `__int__()` and `__float__()` should align with the object's intended use to prevent
#   misleading results (e.g., converting a non-numeric object to an integer).

# Note: Python favors explicit over implicit—hence, it's generally good practice to be explicit with your type conversions when possible.


# ========================================
# 3. Best Practices, Common Pitfalls, and Advanced Tips
# ---------------------------------

def best_practices():
    """Demonstrates best practices for type conversion and casting."""

    # Use explicit conversion for clarity - Always convert types explicitly rather than relying on implicit conversion.
    # This avoids ambiguity and makes your intentions clear to other developers or your future self.
    num_str = "42"
    num = int(num_str)  # Converts string "42" to integer 42. Explicit conversion is preferred for clarity.

    # Use isinstance() for flexible type checking
    # `isinstance` is preferred over `type()` because it supports inheritance. It's also more flexible when
    # handling multiple types using a tuple.
    def process_number(num):
        if isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            return num * 2  # Multiplies `num` by 2 if it's an int or float
        raise TypeError("Expected int or float")  # Provides informative error message if the wrong type is passed

    # Handle potential conversion errors
    # Always use try-except blocks around code that may raise exceptions, such as type conversion, to handle errors gracefully.
    try:
        num = int("not a number")  # This will raise a ValueError
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Conversion error: {e}")  # Logs error message for better debugging

    # Use appropriate numeric types
    from decimal import Decimal
    price = Decimal('19.99')  # Decimal is more precise than float, especially in financial calculations
    # Advanced Tip: Using `Decimal` avoids common floating-point precision issues, making it ideal for handling currency.

def common_pitfalls():
    """Highlights common pitfalls in type conversion and casting."""

    # Loss of precision in float to int conversion
    # Converting from float to int results in truncation, not rounding.
    float_num = 3.99
    int_num = int(float_num)  # Truncates 3.99 to 3
    print(f"Float {float_num} to int: {int_num}")  # Outputs: Float 3.99 to int: 3

    # Unexpected results with boolean conversion
    # Understanding truthy and falsy values in Python is crucial.
    print(f"bool('False'): {bool('False')}")  # True, because any non-empty string evaluates to True
    print(f"bool(0): {bool(0)}")  # False, since 0 is considered falsy
    print(f"bool(0.0): {bool(0.0)}")  # False, for the same reason as `0`
    print(f"bool([]): {bool([])}")  # False, as an empty list is a falsy value

    # Silent truncation in string to float conversion
    # Be cautious with strings that aren't correctly formatted as numbers; this will raise a ValueError.
    str_num = "3.14.15"
    try:
        float_num = float(str_num)  # Raises ValueError because the string is not a valid float
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Conversion error: {e}")  # Informative error message for debugging

    print(process_sequence((1, 2)))  # Works with tuple
    # Advanced Tip: Using `collections.abc` ensures compatibility with any object that implements the Sequence protocol,
    # enhancing the flexibility of your code.

def type_conversion_testing():

# 4. Integration and Real-World Applications
# -----------------------------------------
# This section covers how basic data types are often converted and manipulated in real-world scenarios,

# data analysis, machine learning pipelines, and backend services.
# ========================================

def data_processing_example():
    """Demonstrates type conversion in a data processing scenario."""
    
    # Simulating data from a CSV file (e.g., reading lines from a CSV)
    data = [
        "John,25,1000.50",  # Representing rows as comma-separated strings
        "Jane,30,1500.75",

    ]
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store processed records

    # Loop through each 'record' (string) in 'data'
    for record in data:
        # Splitting the comma-separated string into individual components
        name, age, salary = record.split(',')  # Result: ["John", "25", "1000.50"]
        
        # Construct a dictionary with type conversion for each field
        processed_record = {
            'name': name,              # Name remains a string
            'age': int(age),           # Convert 'age' from string to integer for numerical operations
            'salary': float(salary)    # Convert 'salary' from string to float for calculations

    # Compute the average age
    avg_age = total_age / len(processed_data)  # Avoid hardcoding the length for maintainability
    
    # Displaying results
    print(f"Processed data: {processed_data}")  # Outputs the processed list of dictionaries
    print(f"Average age: {avg_age:.2f}")       # Using formatted string for two decimal precision
    print(f"Total salary: ${total_salary:.2f}")  # Display salary with currency symbol and formatting

# Advanced Tip: Always ensure data conversion happens as early as possible when loading data.
# This minimizes the risk of type-related bugs further down the pipeline.

# Potential Pitfall: Be cautious with data from external sources (e.g., CSVs, databases) as they might
# contain unexpected formats or missing values. Always validate and clean data before processing.

def api_integration_example():
    """Simulates type conversion in API integration."""
    
    # Simulated API response (data as received from a RESTful API)
    api_response = {
        "user_id": "1234",     # User ID as a string, often common in JSON responses
        "name": "Alice",       # Name remains a string
        "is_active": "true",   # Boolean-like values are typically represented as strings ("true"/"false")
        "score": "95.5"        # Numerical values often come as strings in API responses
    }
    
    # Converting the API response into appropriate types
    user = {
        "user_id": int(api_response["user_id"]),        # Convert 'user_id' from string to integer

    }
    
    # Display the converted user object
    print(f"Converted API response: {user}")  # Outputs the dictionary with converted values

# Advanced Tip: API responses often come as JSON objects where all values are strings. Using `.lower()` 
# ensures case-insensitive handling of boolean-like strings, making the code more robust.

# Potential Pitfall: Watch out for unexpected data formats in API responses. For example, a "null" or 
# missing value could cause type conversion to fail. Always include error handling or validation checks.

# Best Practice: For API integrations, consider using libraries like `pydantic` or `marshmallow` for 
# data validation and serialization, which help enforce type safety and avoid conversion errors.

    # Advanced Tip: Using ABCs like `Iterable` makes functions more versatile by allowing them to accept 
    # a broader range of inputs. However, be mindful that not all `Iterable` objects support efficient 
    # random access (e.g., generators), which may affect performance in some scenarios.

        """
        Uses structural pattern matching to identify the type of the provided object.

        - `match` and `case` work similarly to `switch` statements in other languages but are more versatile.
        - The underscore `_` acts as a "wildcard" pattern, matching any type not explicitly specified.

    # Advanced Insight: Structural pattern matching allows more complex matching logic, such as matching on 
    # object attributes, nested structures, or even sequence patterns. It is more expressive than traditional 
    # conditional statements, but since it's relatively new, ensure compatibility (Python 3.10+) when using it.

# 6. FAQs and Troubleshooting
# ---------------------------------
def faqs_and_troubleshooting():
    """Addresses common questions and issues related to type conversion."""
    
    # Q1: How do I convert a string to a datetime object?
    # -------------------------------------------------
    from datetime import datetime  # Importing the `datetime` module, which provides functions to manipulate dates and times
    
    date_string = "2023-09-18 14:30:00"  # Example string representing a date and time
    date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")  
    # `strptime` parses the string into a `datetime` object using the provided format
    # `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` represents year-month-day hour:minute:second in 24-hour format
    
    print(f"Converted datetime: {date_object}")  # Displays the converted datetime object
    
    # Advanced Insight: The `strptime` function is versatile and can handle various date-time formats.
    # Ensure the format string precisely matches the input format, or a `ValueError` will be raised.
    
    # Pitfall: Watch out for mismatches between the input string and the format string.
    # For example, if the input is "18/09/2023", the format should be "%d/%m/%Y", not "%Y-%m-%d".
    
    # -------------------------------------------------
    # Q2: How can I safely convert user input to a number?
    # -------------------------------------------------
    def safe_convert_to_number(value):
        """Attempts to convert a given value to an integer or float. Returns `None` if conversion fails."""
        try:
            return int(value)  # First, attempt to convert the value to an integer
        except ValueError:
            try:
                return float(value)  # If the value can't be an integer, attempt to convert it to a float
            except ValueError:
                return None  # If both conversions fail, return `None`
    
    # Example usage of the `safe_convert_to_number` function
    print(safe_convert_to_number("42"))          # Integer example; outputs: 42
    print(safe_convert_to_number("3.14"))        # Float example; outputs: 3.14
    print(safe_convert_to_number("not a number"))  # Invalid input; outputs: None
    
    # Best Practice: Always validate and sanitize user inputs before processing, especially when working with numeric data.
    # This ensures that the program can handle unexpected input gracefully.
    
    # Advanced Tip: Consider using `decimal.Decimal` for monetary values instead of `float` to avoid precision issues.
    # This is particularly relevant in financial applications where exact decimal representation matters.
    
    # Pitfall: `int()` and `float()` can raise exceptions if the input is not a valid number. Wrapping these in try-except
    # blocks ensures your program doesn't crash on invalid input, providing a more robust solution.
    
    # -------------------------------------------------
    # Q3: How do I handle encoding issues when converting between strings and bytes?
    # -------------------------------------------------
    text = "Hello, 世界"  # A string containing both ASCII and non-ASCII (Unicode) characters
    encoded = text.encode('utf-8')  # Converts the string into a bytes object using UTF-8 encoding
    
    # `encoded` is now a bytes object: `b'Hello, \xe4\xb8\x96\xe7\x95\x8c'`
    # UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding capable of representing every character in the Unicode standard.
    
    decoded = encoded.decode('utf-8')  # Converts the bytes object back to a string using UTF-8 decoding
    
    print(f"Original: {text}")        # Outputs: "Hello, 世界"
    print(f"Encoded: {encoded}")      # Outputs: b'Hello, \xe4\xb8\x96\xe7\x95\x8c'
    print(f"Decoded: {decoded}")      # Outputs: "Hello, 世界"
    
    # Best Practice: Always specify the encoding explicitly (e.g., 'utf-8') when working with string-to-bytes conversions.
    # This ensures your code behaves consistently across different systems and avoids potential issues with default encodings.
    
    # Advanced Insight: UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII and is the most common encoding on the web, making it a safe
    # choice for most applications. However, if you're working with a legacy system, you may encounter other encodings 
    # like `latin-1` or `cp1252`.
    
    # Pitfall: A common error is to try decoding a bytes object with the wrong encoding, which can lead to `UnicodeDecodeError`.
    # Example: Decoding a UTF-8 encoded string with `latin-1` can corrupt data or raise errors.
