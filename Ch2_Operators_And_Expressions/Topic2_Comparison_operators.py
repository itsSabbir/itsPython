# 1. Overview and Historical Context
"""
Comparison operators in Python are fundamental tools for comparing values and making decisions
in programs. They are essential for control flow, sorting, and data analysis.

Historical Context:
- Python's comparison operators have been part of the language since its inception in 1991.
- Python 3 introduced changes to comparison behavior, particularly for ordering of different types.
- The functools.total_ordering decorator was introduced in Python 2.7 to simplify
  the implementation of ordered classes.

In modern software development, comparison operators are crucial for:
- Implementing sorting and searching algorithms
- Data validation and filtering
- Control flow in conditional statements and loops
- Implementing business logic in applications

Compared to other languages:
- Python's comparison operators are similar to those in languages like Java and C++.
- Python allows chaining of comparison operators, which is not common in many other languages.
- Python's 'is' operator for identity comparison is distinct from value comparison ('==').

# ==============================
# Detailed Explanation of Imports
# ------------------------------
# `operator` module:
#   - Contains functions corresponding to standard operators (+, -, *, /, etc.).
#   - Provides performance benefits and allows these operations to be passed as first-class objects (e.g., `operator.eq`).

# `total_ordering` decorator:
#   - Simplifies the implementation of all rich comparison methods.
#   - If you define `__eq__()` and one other method (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), `total_ordering` automatically fills in the others.
#   - This is beneficial for classes that have natural ordering but where defining all comparison methods would be repetitive.

# `unittest` module:
#   - A built-in Python module for writing and running tests.
#   - Promotes a test-driven development (TDD) approach, which is highly regarded as a best practice.
# ==============================

# ========================================
# Example Use of `total_ordering` Decorator
# ----------------------------------------
@total_ordering
class Product:
    """
    A sample class representing a product with a name and price. This class demonstrates the use of
    the `total_ordering` decorator to simplify comparison operations.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, price: float):
        self.name = name  # Name of the product
        self.price = price  # Price of the product
    
    def __eq__(self, other: Any) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(other, Product):
            return NotImplemented
        return self.price == other.price  # Products are considered equal if their prices are equal

    def __lt__(self, other: Any) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(other, Product):
            return NotImplemented
        return self.price < other.price  # A product is considered "less than" another if its price is lower

# ========================================
# Explanation:
# - By using `@total_ordering`, we only needed to implement `__eq__` and `__lt__`.
#   The other comparison methods (`__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`) are automatically generated.
# - This is an excellent example of Python's ability to reduce boilerplate code while maintaining functionality.
# - `NotImplemented` is returned if `other` is not a `Product` instance, which prevents incorrect comparisons.

# Advanced Tip:
# - The `__eq__` and `__lt__` methods can return `NotImplemented` instead of raising an exception, allowing the comparison
#   to fall back to other classesâ€™ comparison methods or raise a `TypeError` later in execution.
# ========================================

# Example Usage and Test Cases
class TestProductComparison(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Unit tests for the `Product` class to validate the comparison functionality.
    """
    
    def setUp(self):
        # Setup runs before each test case
        self.product1 = Product("Laptop", 999.99)
        self.product2 = Product("Smartphone", 599.99)
        self.product3 = Product("Smartphone", 599.99)  # Same price as product2
    
    def test_equality(self):
        """Tests equality comparison"""
        self.assertEqual(self.product2, self.product3)
    
    def test_less_than(self):
        """Tests less than comparison"""
        self.assertLess(self.product2, self.product1)
    
    def test_greater_than(self):
        """Tests greater than comparison"""
        self.assertGreater(self.product1, self.product2)

# ========================================
# Explanation of Test Cases:
# - `setUp` method is part of `unittest.TestCase` and is run before each individual test.
# - The test names are descriptive (`test_equality`, `test_less_than`, etc.), following best practices for test readability.
# - `assertEqual`, `assertLess`, `assertGreater` are part of Python's built-in assertion methods in `unittest`.

# Potential Pitfall:
# - Forgetting to run `super().setUp()` in derived test classes (if using inheritance in test cases) can lead to unexpected behaviors.
# - In production, always ensure that test cases cover edge cases, such as comparing `Product` with `None` or other data types.

# Running the test cases
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#    unittest.main()

# ========================================
# Performance Analysis
# ----------------------------------------
# Comparing the performance of different comparison operators using `timeit`.
# For example, comparing integers vs. strings vs. objects.

# Comparing two integers
int_comparison_time = timeit.timeit("10 == 10", number=1000000)
print(f"Integer comparison took {int_comparison_time} seconds")

# Comparing two strings
str_comparison_time = timeit.timeit("'hello' == 'hello'", number=1000000)
print(f"String comparison took {str_comparison_time} seconds")

# Comparing two objects
product_comparison_time = timeit.timeit("product1 == product2", 
                                        globals=globals(), number=1000000)
print(f"Object comparison took {product_comparison_time} seconds")

# Advanced Insights:
# - Integer comparisons are generally faster than string or object comparisons due to their simpler internal representation.
# - For performance-critical applications, especially in large loops or data processing tasks, be mindful of the data types
#   being compared and the potential overhead of custom comparison logic.

# Potential Optimization:
# - If objects need frequent comparisons, consider implementing `__hash__` for efficient lookups in dictionaries or sets.
# - For more complex objects, caching comparison results (e.g., using `functools.lru_cache`) can improve performance.


# 2. Syntax, Key Concepts, and Code Examples

# Import necessary decorators and modules
from functools import total_ordering  # The @total_ordering decorator helps implement all comparison methods based on a few defined ones
from typing import Any  # 'Any' is used to allow comparisons with multiple types, enhancing flexibility in type checking

def basic_comparisons():
    """Demonstrates basic comparison operations in Python."""
    a, b = 10, 5  # Assigning values to variables 'a' and 'b'. This is a form of tuple unpacking, a Pythonic way to assign multiple variables at once.
    
    # Equality Comparison
    # Checks if the values of 'a' and 'b' are the same.
    # Common Pitfall: '==' compares values, not memory addresses.
    print(f"{a} == {b}: {a == b}")  # Outputs: False since 10 is not equal to 5
    
    # Inequality Comparison
    # Determines if 'a' and 'b' have different values.
    print(f"{a} != {b}: {a != b}")  # Outputs: True since 10 is indeed not equal to 5
    
    # Greater than
    # Checks if 'a' is strictly greater than 'b'.
    print(f"{a} > {b}: {a > b}")  # Outputs: True as 10 is greater than 5
    
    # Less than

    print(f"{a} < {b}: {a < b}")  # Outputs: False since 10 is not less than 5
    
    # Greater than or equal to
    # Checks if 'a' is either greater than or equal to 'b'.
    print(f"{a} >= {b}: {a >= b}")  # Outputs: True, as 10 is greater than 5
    
    # Less than or equal to
    # Determines if 'a' is either less than or equal to 'b'.
    print(f"{a} <= {b}: {a <= b}")  # Outputs: False, as 10 is not less than or equal to 5

def advanced_comparisons():
    """Demonstrates more advanced comparison concepts."""
    # Chaining Comparisons
    # Python allows comparisons to be chained in a mathematically intuitive way.
    # This evaluates as (1 < x) and (x < 10), providing a clean and efficient way to express multiple comparisons.
    x = 5
    print(f"1 < {x} < 10: {1 < x < 10}")  # Outputs: True. This evaluates both conditions sequentially.
    
    # Identity Comparison
    # Demonstrates the difference between '==' (value equality) and 'is' (identity equality)
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]  # Creates a new list in memory
    list2 = [1, 2, 3]  # Creates another separate list with the same values
    list3 = list1  # Assigns 'list3' to reference the same object as 'list1'
    
    # Value Equality
    # '==' checks if the contents (values) of the lists are the same.
    print(f"list1 == list2: {list1 == list2}")  # Outputs: True, as both lists contain identical elements
    
    # Identity Comparison
    # 'is' checks if both variables point to the exact same object in memory.
    print(f"list1 is list2: {list1 is list2}")  # Outputs: False, as 'list1' and 'list2' are distinct objects in memory
    print(f"list1 is list3: {list1 is list3}")  # Outputs: True, as 'list3' is merely a reference to 'list1'
    
    # Comparing Different Types
    # This demonstrates Python's strict type comparison in Python 3.x.
    # Attempting to compare an integer with a string will raise a TypeError.
    try:
        print(f"5 < '10': {5 < '10'}")  # This will raise a TypeError in Python 3, as comparison between int and str is invalid.
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")  # Outputs: TypeError message for demonstration purposes

    """Demonstrates custom comparison for user-defined classes using @total_ordering."""

    # Demonstrating 'less than' comparison
    print(f"alice < bob: {alice < bob}")  # Outputs: True or False based on lexicographical order of (name, age)
    
    # Demonstrating 'less than or equal' comparison using @total_ordering
    # The @total_ordering decorator auto-generates other comparison methods like '<=', '>', '>=' from the defined '__eq__' and '__lt__'.
    print(f"alice <= bob: {alice <= bob}")  # Outputs: Same as above since @total_ordering handles this method derivatively

# ========================================
# 3. Best Practices, Common Pitfalls, and Advanced Tips
# ---------------------------------

def best_practices():
    """Demonstrates best practices for using comparison operators and handling common operations."""

    # Use 'is' for comparing with None
    # ---------------------------------
    # When comparing a variable to 'None', always use 'is' rather than '==' because 'None' is a singleton.
    # This ensures that there's only one instance of 'None' in a Python runtime environment.
    x = None
    if x is None:  # Recommended practice for checking if x is None
        print("x is None")
    
    # Pitfall: Using '==' for comparison with 'None' can be misleading, especially if overloaded equality operators exist.
    # Advanced Tip: Use 'is' for identity checks (None, True, False) but not for value comparisons between regular objects.

    # Avoid comparing floating-point numbers for exact equality
    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic in binary representation, 
    # comparing floating-point numbers using '==' often yields unexpected results.
    import math  # Importing the math module for precision comparison methods
    a, b = 0.1 + 0.2, 0.3
    print(f"0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3: {a == b}")  # Outputs: False, illustrating that 0.1 + 0.2 is not exactly 0.3 in binary
    print(f"math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3): {math.isclose(a, b)}")  # Outputs: True, as isclose accounts for a small tolerance

    # Best Practice: Use 'math.isclose()' for floating-point comparisons, especially when working with scientific or financial data.
    # Advanced Tip: Customize 'rel_tol' (relative tolerance) and 'abs_tol' (absolute tolerance) parameters in 'isclose()' 
    # based on the precision required for your use case.

    # Use 'isinstance()' for type checking
    # -------------------------------------
    # 'isinstance()' is the preferred way to perform type checks, as it respects inheritance and works with multiple types.
    values = [1, "2", 3.0, [4]]  # List containing mixed data types
    for value in values:
        if isinstance(value, (int, float)):  # Checking if 'value' is an instance of either int or float
            print(f"{value} is a number")

    # Pitfall: Using 'type()' for type comparisons doesn't account for inheritance, making it less flexible.
    # Advanced Tip: Prefer 'isinstance()' over 'type()' to maintain compatibility with subclasses or multiple types.

def common_pitfalls():
    """Highlights common pitfalls when working with Python, focusing on mutable default arguments, floating-point comparisons, and reference behavior."""

    # Mutable default arguments
    # -------------------------
    # Using mutable default arguments (e.g., lists or dictionaries) can lead to unintended behavior because 
    # the default value is evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time it's called.
    def append_to(element, lst=[]):  # Dangerous! The list 'lst' persists across function calls
        lst.append(element)
        return lst
    
    print(append_to(1))  # Outputs: [1]
    print(append_to(2))  # Outputs: [1, 2], not [2], due to the shared list reference

    # Best Practice: Use 'None' as the default value and initialize the mutable object inside the function.
    def safe_append_to(element, lst=None):
        if lst is None:
            lst = []  # Create a new list instance for each function call
        lst.append(element)
        return lst
    
    # Advanced Insight: Always be cautious with mutable objects as default parameters, and use 'None' 
    # as a sentinel value to avoid unintentional state persistence across function invocations.

    # Comparing floats for equality
    # -----------------------------
    # As mentioned earlier, floating-point arithmetic results in imprecision. Direct comparisons using '==' 
    # may not behave as expected.
    print(f"0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3: {0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3}")  # Outputs: False due to floating-point imprecision

    # Best Practice: Always use 'math.isclose()' when checking for equality between floats, specifying tolerance levels if needed.

    # Chaining assignments and object references
    # ------------------------------------------
    # In Python, variables are references to objects. Multiple variables can point to the same mutable object, 
    # causing unintended modifications.
    x = y = [1, 2, 3]  # Both 'x' and 'y' reference the same list object
    y.append(4)  # Modifying 'y' also changes 'x'
    print(f"x: {x}")  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4], indicating 'x' and 'y' are the same object

    # Pitfall: Chained assignment results in multiple variables referencing the same object. 
    # Always use copying if independent objects are needed.

    # Advanced Tip: Use 'copy()' from the 'copy' module for shallow copies and 'copy.deepcopy()' for deep copies.
    import copy
    x = [1, 2, 3]
    y = copy.copy(x)  # Creates a shallow copy of 'x', meaning 'y' is now an independent list
    y.append(4)
    print(f"x (after shallow copy modification): {x}")  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3], showing 'x' remains unaffected

    # Explanation: 'copy.copy()' only creates a shallow copy; thus, changes to nested objects still affect the original list.
    # Use 'copy.deepcopy()' to fully copy all nested objects for complete independence.
    z = copy.deepcopy(x)
    z.append(5)
    print(f"x (after deep copy modification): {x}")  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3], showing 'x' remains fully independent

# ========================================
# Summary
# ---------------------------------------
# - Prefer 'is' over '==' for None checks to avoid confusion and ensure correctness.
# - Avoid mutable default arguments in function definitions; use 'None' as a default and initialize inside the function.
# - Use 'math.isclose()' for float comparisons to account for precision issues.
# - Understand the difference between shallow and deep copies to manage object references correctly.
# - Utilize 'isinstance()' for type checks to handle inheritance and multiple types efficiently.

# emphasizing not just how the code works but why certain practices are recommended, along with their potential pitfalls and advanced insights.


def advanced_tips():
    """Provides advanced tips for working with comparison operators and sorting techniques."""

    # Using the 'operator' module for functional programming
    # -----------------------------------------------------
    # The 'operator' module provides efficient, readable, and concise ways to perform 
    # operations that would otherwise require lambda functions or custom logic. 
    import operator
    
    # Sorting a list of numbers using 'operator.neg'
    numbers = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]
    
    # 'operator.neg' is a function that returns the negation of its argument. By using this
    # as the key for sorting, we effectively sort in descending order.
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=operator.neg)  # Equivalent to sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
    print(f"Sorted numbers: {sorted_numbers}")
    
    # Explanation: Using 'operator.neg' in this context offers a more functional programming
    # style approach. It is often more efficient and readable than using an explicit lambda,
    # e.g., sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: -x).
    
    # Advanced Insight: The 'operator' module contains many other useful functions like
    # 'operator.add', 'operator.mul', and 'operator.itemgetter', which are valuable when
    # writing concise and efficient functional-style code.

    # Custom sorting with 'functools.cmp_to_key'
    # ------------------------------------------
    # 'cmp_to_key' is used to convert an old-style comparison function (that returns -1, 0, or 1)
    # into a key function suitable for use with 'sorted()' or other functions requiring a key argument.
    from functools import cmp_to_key
    
    def compare(a, b):
        return len(str(a)) - len(str(b))  # Custom comparison based on string length

    # List of numbers to sort based on the length of their string representation
    numbers = [1, 1000, 10, 100, 10000]
    
    # Sorting using the 'compare' function wrapped in 'cmp_to_key' to convert it to a key function
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=cmp_to_key(compare))
    print(f"Sorted by string length: {sorted_numbers}")
    
    # Advanced Tip: Although 'cmp_to_key' is powerful, it is usually slower than using a direct 'key' 
    # function because of the overhead of the comparison logic. It's more efficient to use a 'key' function
    # whenever possible (e.g., key=len(str(x))).

    # Pitfall: The 'cmp_to_key' approach is less intuitive for those unfamiliar with the older 
    # comparison-based sorting model. Use it when you have complex comparison logic that cannot be 
    # easily translated into a simple key function.

def write_testable_code():

    # It's always a good practice to keep functions focused and avoid side effects.

    # Using the 'unittest' module to test the 'is_adult' function

    # Best Practice: Test boundary cases, such as the exact threshold (18), to ensure accurate functionality.
    # This ensures that the function handles edge cases correctly.

    # Running the tests
    # -----------------
    # 'unittest.main()' allows the tests to be run in the script or from the command line.
    # 'argv=['']' is used to prevent unittest from interpreting IPython or Jupyter notebook arguments.
    unittest.main(argv=[''], exit=False)
    
    # Pitfall: Forgetting to include 'exit=False' in environments like Jupyter notebooks will cause the 
    # entire notebook to terminate after running the tests. Always include this argument in such environments.

    # Advanced Insight: Consider using other testing frameworks like 'pytest' for more advanced features 
    # like fixtures, parameterized testing, and better reporting. 'pytest' can also run unittest-based tests, 
    # making it easy to extend existing test cases.

# ========================================
# Summary
# ---------------------------------------
# - Utilize the 'operator' module for cleaner, more efficient functional programming.
# - Use 'cmp_to_key' when custom comparison logic is required, but prefer direct 'key' functions for efficiency.
# - Write testable code by keeping functions simple and using Python's built-in 'unittest' framework for structured testing.
# - Consider using more advanced testing frameworks like 'pytest' as your projects grow in complexity.

    """Demonstrates the use of comparison operators in a sorting algorithm, specifically using Bubble Sort."""

    # Bubble Sort Implementation
    # --------------------------
    # Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list,
    # compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats
    # until the list is sorted.

        n = len(arr)  # Get the length of the array
        # Explanation: 'n' determines the number of iterations required for the outer loop.
        
        for i in range(n):  # Outer loop iterates over the array
            # In each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.
            
            # Optimization: A flag to monitor whether any swaps occurred in the current pass
            swapped = False

            for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
                # The inner loop iterates from the start of the array up to the unsorted section
                
                # Comparison operation: If the current element is greater than the next one, swap them
                if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                    arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]  # Swap the elements using tuple unpacking
                    swapped = True  # Indicate that a swap occurred

            # Optimization: If no swaps occurred in a pass, the array is already sorted
            if not swapped:
                break
        
        # Explanation: Bubble Sort has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n^2) and a best-case 
        # complexity of O(n) when the list is already sorted. It is not suitable for large datasets due 
        # to its inefficiency but is easy to implement and understand, making it useful for educational purposes.
        return arr
    
    # Example list of integers to sort
    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)  # Sorting the numbers using Bubble Sort
    print(f"Sorted numbers: {sorted_numbers}")  # Outputs: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

    # Advanced Tip: For real-world applications, consider using more efficient sorting algorithms such as
    # QuickSort (average time complexity O(n log n)), Merge Sort, or using Pythonâ€™s built-in 'sorted()' function,
    # which implements Timsort (a hybrid sorting algorithm with O(n log n) complexity).

def data_validation_example():
    """Demonstrates the use of comparison operators in data validation for user input."""

    # Explanation: Data validation is crucial in real-world applications to ensure that user input meets
    # expected criteria. This example covers validation for age and username length.

    def validate_age(age: int) -> bool:
        # Validates that age is within a reasonable human range (0 to 120 years inclusive)
        
        # The comparison operator '0 <= age <= 120' checks that 'age' falls within the valid range
        return 0 <= age <= 120
    
        # Explanation: Using chained comparison operators like '0 <= age <= 120' is not only concise 
        # but also more readable and efficient than separate comparisons (e.g., 'age >= 0 and age <= 120').

    def validate_username(username: str) -> bool:
        # Validates that the username length is between 3 and 20 characters inclusive
        
        # The comparison '3 <= len(username) <= 20' ensures that the username is of valid length
        return 3 <= len(username) <= 20
    
        # Advanced Tip: Validate user input early and often (i.e., at the point of entry) to avoid 
        # potential issues down the line, such as database errors or security vulnerabilities.

    # Demonstrating the validation functions with various inputs
    print(f"Is age 25 valid? {validate_age(25)}")  # Outputs: True, as 25 is within the valid age range
    print(f"Is age -5 valid? {validate_age(-5)}")  # Outputs: False, as -5 is not a valid age
    print(f"Is username 'john_doe' valid? {validate_username('john_doe')}")  # Outputs: True, valid length
    print(f"Is username 'a' valid? {validate_username('a')}")  # Outputs: False, length is less than 3

    # Integration Insight: These validation techniques are essential for ensuring data integrity when 
    # accepting input from users in web forms, APIs, or any other interactive systems.

# ========================================
# Summary of Real-World Application Best Practices
# ---------------------------------------
# - When implementing sorting algorithms, always consider the data size and choose an appropriate algorithm.
#   Bubble Sort is educational but inefficient for large datasets.
# - Use built-in Python functions ('sorted()', 'sort()') for optimized performance in most cases, as they 
#   leverage highly efficient algorithms (Timsort).
# - Implement data validation using comparison operators to ensure input data conforms to expected formats 
#   and ranges, which helps prevent invalid or potentially harmful data from affecting your application.
# - Use type hints for function parameters and return types to improve code clarity, maintainability, and to 
#   catch potential type-related errors early in the development process.

# This thorough commentary provides a deep understanding of both fundamental and advanced aspects of integrating 
# comparison operators in real-world applications, making it an invaluable resource for someone advancing toward 
# a principal engineer level.

# 5. Advanced Concepts and Emerging Trends
# ---------------------------------------

def advanced_concepts():
    """Explores advanced concepts and emerging trends related to comparison operators, 
    showcasing features like rich comparison methods and structural pattern matching."""

    # Rich Comparison Methods (Python 3.7+)
    # -------------------------------------
    # Rich comparison methods allow objects to be compared using operators like '==', '!=', '<', '<=', '>', and '>='.
    # By implementing these methods, you can define custom behavior for comparison between instances of a class.
    
    # Defining a class 'Temperature' that implements rich comparison
    class Temperature:
        def __init__(self, celsius):
            self.celsius = celsius  # Initialize the temperature in Celsius
        
        # Implementing the '__eq__' method to handle equality checks
        def __eq__(self, other):
            # Check if 'other' is an int or float, allowing comparison between Temperature and numeric types
            if isinstance(other, (int, float)):
                return self.celsius == other  # Compare the celsius value with the numeric 'other'
            # Check if 'other' is another instance of Temperature
            if isinstance(other, Temperature):
                return self.celsius == other.celsius  # Compare based on their 'celsius' attribute
            # If 'other' is neither a Temperature instance nor a numeric type, return 'NotImplemented'
            # This allows Python to attempt other ways to compare or raise an appropriate error
            return NotImplemented
    
    # Creating instances of the Temperature class
    temp1 = Temperature(25)  # Represents 25 degrees Celsius
    temp2 = Temperature(25)  # Another instance representing 25 degrees Celsius
    
    # Demonstrating comparisons
    print(f"temp1 == temp2: {temp1 == temp2}")  # True, because their celsius values are the same
    print(f"temp1 == 25: {temp1 == 25}")  # True, demonstrating comparison with a numeric value
    
    # Explanation: 
    # The '__eq__' method enables the Temperature class to handle equality checks between Temperature instances 
    # and numeric types. Without this method, 'temp1 == temp2' would return False because Python defaults to checking 
    # object identity (i.e., whether they are the same object in memory).

    # Advanced Tip: Implement additional rich comparison methods such as '__lt__' (less than), '__le__' (less than or equal to),
    # '__gt__' (greater than), and '__ge__' (greater than or equal to) for comprehensive comparison support.
    # Alternatively, the 'functools.total_ordering' decorator can simplify implementing all comparison methods
    # by defining just a couple of them.

    # Potential Pitfall: Ensure that comparisons between incompatible types return 'NotImplemented' instead of False.
    # This allows Python's internal mechanism to handle or raise the appropriate error, maintaining consistent behavior.

    # Structural Pattern Matching (Python 3.10+)
    # ------------------------------------------
    # Structural pattern matching is an advanced control flow feature introduced in Python 3.10, similar to 'switch' 
    # statements found in other languages but much more powerful. It allows for matching complex data structures
    # based on their shape, contents, or specific conditions.

    # Defining a function that uses structural pattern matching to categorize numbers
    def compare_values(value):
        match value:
            # Case for negative values
            case x if x < 0:
                return "Negative"
            # Case for zero
            case 0:
                return "Zero"
            # Case for positive values
            case x if x > 0:
                return "Positive"
    
    # Testing the function with different values
    print(f"Compare -5: {compare_values(-5)}")  # Outputs: "Negative"
    print(f"Compare 0: {compare_values(0)}")    # Outputs: "Zero"
    print(f"Compare 10: {compare_values(10)}")  # Outputs: "Positive"

    # Explanation:
    # The 'match' statement evaluates the 'value' and tries to find the first 'case' that matches.
    # When a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed.

    # Advanced Tip: Structural pattern matching is not limited to simple values. It can be used to match complex
    # data structures such as dictionaries, lists, tuples, and custom objects, making it exceptionally powerful 
    # for handling nested or hierarchical data.

    # Example of more advanced structural pattern matching:
    def process_data(data):
        match data:
            case {"name": str(name), "age": int(age)} if age > 18:
                return f"Adult: {name}"
            case {"name": str(name), "age": int(age)}:
                return f"Minor: {name}"
            case _:
                return "Unknown format"

    print(process_data({"name": "Alice", "age": 30}))  # Outputs: "Adult: Alice"
    print(process_data({"name": "Bob", "age": 15}))    # Outputs: "Minor: Bob"
    print(process_data({"title": "Engineer"}))         # Outputs: "Unknown format"

    # Explanation:
    # In this example, the function 'process_data' matches dictionaries with specific keys and values.
    # The 'case' statements allow for sophisticated data extraction and conditional checks.

    # Emerging Trend: Pattern matching opens up new possibilities for concise, readable, and maintainable code,
    # especially when dealing with complex data structures, parsing tasks, or implementing state machines.

# ========================================
# Summary
# ---------------------------------------
# - Rich comparison methods ('__eq__', '__lt__', etc.) allow custom comparison logic between class instances.
# - Always return 'NotImplemented' when handling comparisons with unsupported types to ensure consistent behavior.
# - Structural pattern matching, introduced in Python 3.10, is a powerful tool for handling complex data structures
#   and provides a more expressive way to implement conditional logic.
# - These advanced concepts and emerging trends are crucial for writing flexible, efficient, and maintainable code,
#   especially in large-scale or data-intensive applications.

# This section aims to provide a deep understanding of advanced Python features, demonstrating their practical
# applications, potential pitfalls, and advanced tips, thereby serving as a guide for developers aspiring to 
# become principal engineers.


# ========================================
# 6. FAQs and Troubleshooting
# ---------------------------------------

def faqs_and_troubleshooting():
    """Addresses common questions and issues related to comparison operators and their behavior in Python."""
    
    # Q: Why doesn't "a" < "B" work as expected?
    # -----------------------------------------
    # Explanation: In Python, strings are compared lexicographically using their ASCII/Unicode values.
    # The comparison 'a' < 'B' evaluates based on their ASCII values: 'a' has a value of 97, while 'B' has a value of 66.
    # Since 97 > 66, the expression 'a' < 'B' evaluates to False, which can be counterintuitive if you expect 
    # case-insensitive behavior.
    print(f"'a' < 'B': {'a' < 'B'}")  # Outputs: False

    # Best Practice: For case-insensitive comparisons, convert both strings to the same case using 'str.lower()' or 'str.upper()'.
    print("Use str.lower() for case-insensitive comparison:")
    print(f"'a'.lower() < 'B'.lower(): {'a'.lower() < 'B'.lower()}")  # Outputs: True
    
    # Advanced Tip: When performing case-insensitive comparisons frequently, consider using str.casefold() instead of str.lower(),
    # as str.casefold() is more aggressive and handles certain edge cases in international text.

    # Potential Pitfall: Be cautious when comparing strings of different encodings or formats. Ensure consistent encoding 
    # when handling byte strings (b'string') vs. regular strings ('string') to avoid unexpected comparison results.

    # Q: How do I compare objects of different types?
    # -----------------------------------------------
    # Explanation: Python allows you to define custom comparison logic for objects by implementing special methods like
    # __lt__ (less than), __gt__ (greater than), __eq__ (equal), etc. This is especially useful when comparing instances 
    # of different classes that should be considered comparable.

    class Cat:
        def __init__(self, age):
            self.age = age  # Age attribute defines the cat's age

    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, age):
            self.age = age  # Age attribute defines the dog's age

        def __lt__(self, other):
            # Check if 'other' is an instance of Cat or Dog to support comparison between different types
            if isinstance(other, (Cat, Dog)):
                return self.age < other.age  # Compare based on the 'age' attribute
            return NotImplemented  # If 'other' is not a comparable type, return NotImplemented

    # Creating instances of Cat and Dog
    cat = Cat(5)
    dog = Dog(3)
    print(f"dog < cat: {dog < cat}")  # Outputs: True, as 3 (dog's age) is less than 5 (cat's age)

    # Best Practice: Always use 'isinstance()' in comparison methods to ensure type compatibility and avoid 
    # TypeErrors. Return NotImplemented if the comparison is not supported for the given type.

    # Advanced Insight: Implementing rich comparison methods (__lt__, __le__, __eq__, __ne__, __gt__, __ge__) 
    # allows objects to be compared using all standard comparison operators, making them work seamlessly with 
    # built-in functions like sorted() and min().

    # Q: How can I sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key?
    # ----------------------------------------------------------
    # Explanation: When working with collections of dictionaries, such as when querying APIs or handling JSON data,
    # you often need to sort by a specific key. The 'sorted()' function, along with the 'key' parameter, makes this easy.

    people = [{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]  # List of dictionaries containing peopleâ€™s details
    # Using 'sorted()' to sort the list by the 'age' key
    sorted_people = sorted(people, key=lambda x: x["age"])
    print(f"Sorted people: {sorted_people}")  # Outputs: [{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}]

    # Best Practice: Use 'lambda' functions or 'operator.itemgetter' for concise and efficient sorting by dictionary keys.
    from operator import itemgetter
    sorted_people_alternative = sorted(people, key=itemgetter("age"))  # Using itemgetter for potentially faster lookups
    print(f"Sorted people (using itemgetter): {sorted_people_alternative}")

    # Potential Pitfall: When sorting dictionaries, ensure that all entries contain the key you're sorting by.
    # Missing keys will result in a KeyError. Use a 'try-except' block or specify a default value using 'dict.get' 
    # to handle cases where the key might be absent.

    # Advanced Tip: For complex sorting (e.g., sorting by multiple keys), use tuples in the 'key' parameter:
    # sorted(people, key=lambda x: (x['age'], x['name']))
    # This allows sorting by 'age' first, and then by 'name' for entries with the same age.

# ========================================
# Summary
# ---------------------------------------
# - Understand that string comparisons in Python are case-sensitive based on ASCII/Unicode values.
# - Implement rich comparison methods for custom objects to enable flexible and intuitive comparisons.
# - Use 'sorted()' with lambda functions or 'itemgetter' for efficient sorting of dictionaries.
# - Always handle potential pitfalls, such as missing keys in dictionaries or incompatible types in comparisons.

# This thorough explanation serves as an advanced guide to common questions and troubleshooting scenarios
# involving comparison operators, providing foundational knowledge, best practices, potential pitfalls, 
# and advanced techniques suitable for developers aiming to progress to a senior or principal engineer level.

# 7. Recommended Tools, Libraries, and Resources
# ---------------------------------------------

"""
Recommended Tools and Libraries for Working with Comparison Operators and More:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. operator module (built-in)
   - Overview: The 'operator' module provides a functional interface to many of Python's built-in operators 
     (e.g., arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operations). Using this module can lead to more 
     readable and concise code, especially when passing operators as functions to higher-order functions 
     like 'map', 'filter', or 'reduce'.
   - Example Usage:
     ```
     import operator
     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     result = list(map(operator.mul, numbers, numbers))  # Square each element
     print(result)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
     ```
   - Advanced Insight: The 'operator' module is particularly useful in scenarios requiring functional 
     programming paradigms, such as when writing code that requires dynamic dispatching or avoiding lambda 
     functions for better readability. This can lead to more efficient and expressive code in complex 
     algorithms.

2. functools module (built-in)
   - Overview: The 'functools' module offers higher-order functions that work on callable objects. It's 
     particularly useful when working with comparison operators, as it provides tools like 'cmp_to_key', 
     'partial', and 'reduce', which facilitate advanced function manipulation and application.
   - Example Usage:
     ```
     from functools import cmp_to_key
     
     def compare(a, b):
         return (a > b) - (a < b)
     
     sorted_list = sorted([5, 2, 4, 1, 3], key=cmp_to_key(compare))
     print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     ```
   - Advanced Tip: Using 'functools.lru_cache' (Least Recently Used cache) can optimize recursive comparison 
     operations, especially when dealing with computationally expensive comparisons or sorting tasks in 
     complex algorithms.

3. unittest module (built-in)
   - Overview: 'unittest' is Python's standard testing framework, providing robust tools for writing and 
     running test cases. It's crucial for ensuring that your comparison logic and operator-based code 
     function correctly, especially in larger projects.
   - Example Usage:
     ```
     import unittest
     
     class TestComparison(unittest.TestCase):
         def test_equality(self):
             self.assertEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, msg="Floating point comparison failed")

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         unittest.main()
     ```
   - Best Practice: Integrate 'unittest' into your development workflow to catch bugs early and ensure 
     robustness. For more sophisticated testing, explore combining 'unittest' with 'mock' for testing 
     functions with external dependencies.

4. hypothesis (third-party library)
   - Overview: 'hypothesis' is a property-based testing library that generates test cases based on the 
     properties you define, ensuring comprehensive testing beyond what traditional unit tests can achieve. 
     It is particularly effective for testing code that involves comparison operators, as it can uncover 
     edge cases that are easy to miss.
   - Installation: `pip install hypothesis`
   - Example Usage:
     ```
     from hypothesis import given
     import hypothesis.strategies as st
     
     @given(st.integers(), st.integers())
     def test_commutative_property(a, b):
         assert a + b == b + a
     ```
   - Advanced Tip: Use 'hypothesis' to test your code against a wide range of inputs, especially when dealing 
     with floating-point arithmetic or custom comparison functions. It can help identify edge cases that 
     might be overlooked in manual testing.

    # Generate a list of 1,000 random integers between 1 and 1,000 for testing
    arr = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(1000)]

    # Measure the time taken for each sorting method over 10 runs
    time_bubble = timeit.timeit(lambda: bubble_sort(arr.copy()), number=10)
    time_quick = timeit.timeit(lambda: quick_sort(arr.copy()), number=10)
    time_sorted = timeit.timeit(lambda: sorted(arr), number=10)  # Using Python's built-in 'sorted()' function

    print(f"Time for bubble sort: {time_bubble:.6f} seconds")  # Outputs the total time taken by bubble sort
    print(f"Time for quick sort: {time_quick:.6f} seconds")    # Outputs the total time taken by quick sort
    print(f"Time for Python's sorted(): {time_sorted:.6f} seconds")  # Outputs the total time taken by built-in sort

    # Analysis:
    # Bubble Sort: O(n^2) time complexity, making it highly inefficient for large datasets. It performs poorly even on moderately-sized lists.
    # Quick Sort: O(n log n) on average, significantly faster than Bubble Sort for large datasets. However, it has a worst-case complexity of O(n^2),
    # which occurs when the pivot selection is poor (e.g., always choosing the smallest or largest element).
    # Python's 'sorted()': Uses Timsort (a hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort) with O(n log n) worst-case time complexity,
    # making it highly efficient and optimized for real-world use cases.

    # Advanced Tip: When choosing a sorting algorithm, consider not just average-case time complexity but also the worst-case scenario
    # and the space complexity. For most applications, Python's built-in 'sorted()' function is highly optimized and preferable.

    # Potential Pitfall: Be cautious with recursive algorithms like Quick Sort, which can lead to stack overflow issues with extremely large datasets
    # or poorly balanced partitions. This can be mitigated by implementing an iterative version or using tail recursion optimization if supported by the language.

# ========================================
# Summary
# ---------------------------------------
# - Use 'is' for identity comparisons when appropriate, as it is faster than '==' for comparing object references.
# - Prefer Python's built-in 'sorted()' function for most sorting tasks, as it is highly optimized.
# - Understand the time and space complexities of different sorting algorithms to make informed choices based on data size and structure.
# - The 'timeit' module provides an accurate way to measure the performance of small code snippets, essential for optimization analysis.

# The goal of these comments is to provide an in-depth understanding of performance analysis and optimization techniques,
# emphasizing the importance of choosing the right tools and methods for efficiency, while being aware of potential pitfalls.

# Advanced Tips and Insights for Main Function Implementation
# ---------------------------------------

# 1. Separation of Concerns:
# - The main function acts as a coordinator, calling different functions to demonstrate specific concepts. 
#   This is an example of the separation of concerns principle, which makes code easier to read, maintain, and test.

# 2. Using Descriptive Function Names:
# - Function names such as `basic_comparisons` and `advanced_tips` clearly convey their purpose, 
#   improving the readability and maintainability of the code.

# 3. Efficient Use of Print Statements:
# - Print statements are used to label each section before execution. This simple practice provides clarity when 
#   reviewing console output, making it easier to identify which section of the code is being executed.

# 4. Import Guard (`if __name__ == "__main__"`):
# - This idiom prevents code from executing when the module is imported elsewhere, demonstrating a clear understanding 
#   of how Python scripts behave when run directly vs. when imported.

# 5. Extensibility:
# - The design of the `main()` function makes it easy to add, remove, or modify sections of the code. This enhances 
#   the overall extensibility and flexibility of the script, which is crucial for larger, evolving projects.

# 6. Avoiding Hard-Coded Values:
# - While this example doesn't involve hard-coded values, it's good practice to avoid embedding literals directly 
#   in your functions. Instead, use constants or configuration files for values that may change or need adjustment.

# 7. Comment Quality:
# - Each function call is explained clearly, and additional context is provided to ensure understanding, which 
#   is essential for a principal-level engineer who needs to convey information to team members of all skill levels.

# ========================================
# Final Thought
# ---------------------------------------
# Writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code is an essential skill for software engineers at all levels.
# This example illustrates not just how to write a main function but how to structure, document, and build code 
# in a way that is scalable, extensible, and suitable for collaboration in a professional environment.
