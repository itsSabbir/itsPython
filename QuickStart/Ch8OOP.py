# Python Cheat Sheet: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# 1. Classes and Objects
# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python revolves around the concept of 'objects', which are instances
# of classes. Classes are blueprints that define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects.

# Example: Defining a simple class 'Dog' with attributes and methods

class Dog:
    # Class attribute (shared across all instances of the class)
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # This is a class-level attribute common to all dogs

    # Constructor (__init__ method) is called when creating an object
    # It initializes the instance attributes (specific to each object)
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes
        self.name = name  # Assign the 'name' passed during object creation to the instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Assign the 'age' passed during object creation to the instance attribute

    # Instance method (works with object-specific data)
    def bark(self):
        # Instance methods can access and manipulate the instance's data (i.e., self.name)
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"  # Returns a string with the dog's name and a bark sound

    # String representation (__str__) for human-readable output
    # This method is invoked when print() is called on the object
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"  # Defines how the object should be displayed as a string

    # Representation (__repr__) for developer-friendly output
    # Typically used for debugging purposes and provides more technical details about the object
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Dog('{self.name}', {self.age})"  # This string is how the object is represented in the console

# Creating objects (instances of the 'Dog' class)
# Each instance has its own set of attributes (name, age) but shares the class attribute 'species'
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)  # Create an instance 'dog1' with name 'Buddy' and age 3
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)    # Create another instance 'dog2' with name 'Max' and age 5

# Accessing instance methods
print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
# Explanation: The 'bark' method is called on 'dog1'. It returns "Buddy says Woof!" where 'Buddy' is the name of the dog.

# Accessing the __str__ method
print(dog2)  # Output: Max is 5 years old
# Explanation: When 'print' is called on 'dog2', it implicitly uses the __str__ method to generate a human-readable string.

# Accessing class attributes
print(Dog.species)  # Output: Canis familiaris
# Explanation: 'species' is a class attribute, accessible via the class itself (Dog) or any instance. It is common to all dogs.

# Advanced tip:
# The distinction between __str__ and __repr__:
# - __str__ is used for end-users to present a readable description of the object.
# - __repr__ is aimed at developers, and its goal is to be unambiguous and ideally allow us to recreate the object.
# It's a best practice to have both methods in custom classes, as they serve different use cases.

# Tip: Use __init__ for object initialization
# __init__ is primarily used to set up instance attributes. Avoid using it for complex logic or time-consuming operations
# as it should remain lightweight. For more advanced setup, consider using separate methods.
# __init__ should focus on preparing the object for use, while leaving additional configuration to other methods.

# Potential pitfalls:
# Forgetting 'self' in method definitions: 
# In Python, instance methods must explicitly include 'self' as their first parameter, 
# which refers to the instance the method is being called on. Missing 'self' will raise an error.

# Uncommon insights:
# When you define an attribute on the class level (like 'species'), it is shared by all instances of the class.
# However, instance attributes (like 'name' and 'age') are unique to each object.
# Be careful with mutable class attributes (like lists or dictionaries), as changes to them affect all instances, 
# which may lead to unintended side effects.

# Use case: 
# In larger projects, classes are used to model real-world entities with both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
# OOP encourages encapsulation (hiding internal details and exposing only necessary functionality),
# which enhances modularity and maintainability of code.

#=================================================================================
# 2. Inheritance
#=================================================================================

# Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes
# and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse, better organization, and the ability to create a class hierarchy.
# In Python, inheritance is implemented by defining a new class that receives the properties and behaviors of an existing class.

# Example: Base class 'Animal' with subclasses 'Cat' and 'Dog'

# Step 1: Defining the base class 'Animal'
# The base class 'Animal' provides the blueprint for all animal types.
# It has a constructor (__init__) to initialize the 'name' attribute, and a placeholder 'speak' method.
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        # Initializing the 'name' attribute for the animal, which will be shared by all subclasses
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        # 'speak' is a method meant to be overridden by subclasses, so it currently does nothing (pass).
        # This approach makes the base class more abstract and flexible, as specific behaviors are defined by subclasses.
        pass

# Step 2: Creating a subclass 'Cat' that inherits from 'Animal'
# The 'Cat' class inherits the 'name' attribute and any methods from 'Animal'.
# However, it overrides the 'speak' method to provide a cat-specific behavior.
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        # 'speak' is overridden to provide a behavior specific to cats.
        # It returns a string that includes the cat's name and its characteristic sound, "Meow!".
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

# Step 3: Creating a subclass 'Dog' that also inherits from 'Animal'
# Similar to 'Cat', 'Dog' inherits from 'Animal' and overrides the 'speak' method to provide dog-specific behavior.
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        # 'speak' is overridden to provide a behavior specific to dogs.
        # It returns a string that includes the dog's name and its characteristic sound, "Woof!".
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

# Creating instances of 'Cat' and 'Dog'
cat = Cat("Whiskers")  # Instantiating a 'Cat' object named "Whiskers"
dog = Dog("Rex")       # Instantiating a 'Dog' object named "Rex"

# Printing the output of calling the 'speak' method on each object
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow!
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Rex says Woof!

# Both 'cat' and 'dog' objects inherit the 'name' attribute from 'Animal', but they each have their own implementation of the 'speak' method.
# This is an example of polymorphism, where the same method name ('speak') behaves differently depending on the object's class.

# Tip: 
# Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of related classes. 
# The base class (Animal) can define shared properties and behaviors, while the derived classes (Cat, Dog) can 
# implement or override specific functionality. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and reusable code.

# Use case:
# Inheritance is especially useful when you have a collection of related objects that share common behavior but need specialized functionality.
# For example, you might have a base class Vehicle with subclasses like Car, Bike, and Truck. Each subclass would inherit common properties 
# like 'speed' and 'capacity' from Vehicle but would override or extend functionality with vehicle-specific behaviors.

# Advanced Tip:
# In some cases, you might want to make the base class completely abstract, enforcing that certain methods must be implemented by all subclasses.
# You can achieve this using the 'abc' (Abstract Base Class) module in Python, which allows you to define abstract methods that have no implementation 
# in the base class but must be implemented by any subclass.
# 
# Example:
# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
# class Animal(ABC):
#     @abstractmethod
#     def speak(self):
#         pass
# This ensures that any subclass of Animal must implement the 'speak' method, making the hierarchy more robust.

# Potential Pitfalls:
# - Be mindful of overly deep inheritance chains, as they can make your code harder to maintain and understand.
# - A common beginner mistake is to forget to call the base class's constructor (i.e., 'super().__init__(...)') 
#   when the subclass requires additional initialization beyond what's provided by the base class.
#   However, in this example, since the subclass does not introduce new attributes, calling 'super()' is unnecessary.

# Best practice: 
# Use inheritance to model "is-a" relationships. For instance, a 'Dog' is a type of 'Animal'.
# Avoid using inheritance where composition (has-a relationships) might be more appropriate. For example, instead of inheriting from a 'Wheel' class, 
# a 'Car' class should have 'Wheel' objects.

#=================================================================================
# 3. Multiple Inheritance
#=================================================================================

# Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.
# This can be useful when you want a class to have behaviors or attributes from different sources.
# However, multiple inheritance can lead to complexity, especially when dealing with the method resolution order (MRO),
# where Python determines the order in which to search for methods in a hierarchy.

# Example 1: Defining two base classes 'Flyable' and 'Swimmable'
class Flyable:
    def fly(self):
        return "I can fly!"  # Method to simulate flying behavior

class Swimmable:
    def swim(self):
        return "I can swim!"  # Method to simulate swimming behavior

# Example 2: Defining a class 'Duck' that inherits from both Flyable and Swimmable
# This allows the 'Duck' class to have both 'fly' and 'swim' methods, in addition to its own behaviors
# Correction: We need to define 'Animal' as the base class or remove it since it was not provided.
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):  # Adding an init method to give the 'Duck' an attribute 'name'
        self.name = name

class Duck(Animal, Flyable, Swimmable):
    # The Duck class can now inherit methods from Animal, Flyable, and Swimmable
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Quack!"  # The duck 'speaks' by returning a string with its name and "Quack!"

# Creating an instance of 'Duck'
duck = Duck("Donald")  # Creating a duck named "Donald"
print(duck.speak())  # Output: Donald says Quack!
# The 'speak' method is called from the Duck class

print(duck.fly())  # Output: I can fly!
# The 'fly' method is inherited from the Flyable class

print(duck.swim())  # Output: I can swim!
# The 'swim' method is inherited from the Swimmable class

# Tip: Be cautious with multiple inheritance, as it can lead to complex hierarchies.
# In this case, it's relatively simple because each class has unique methods, but conflicts can arise if
# two parent classes define the same method. Python uses a rule called Method Resolution Order (MRO) to decide
# which method to invoke in case of conflicts. MRO follows the C3 linearization algorithm, which ensures a consistent and predictable order.
# You can check the MRO of a class using the 'mro()' method or the '__mro__' attribute.

# Advanced tip:
# When designing with multiple inheritance, be mindful of the "diamond problem," where a class inherits from two classes 
# that both inherit from a common ancestor. This can lead to ambiguity in method resolution if both base classes override 
# a method from the common ancestor. Python solves this with MRO, but in some situations, it might still lead to hard-to-debug behavior.
# For such scenarios, consider whether composition (having objects of other classes as attributes) may be a better approach than inheritance.

# Example of checking MRO:
print(Duck.mro())  # Shows the order of method resolution
# Output: [<class '__main__.Duck'>, <class '__main__.Animal'>, <class '__main__.Flyable'>, <class '__main__.Swimmable'>, <class 'object'>]

# Best practice:
# Only use multiple inheritance when it's truly needed to model complex behavior and ensure you understand MRO.
# Composition is often preferred when you can delegate behaviors to other objects instead of using multiple inheritance.

#=================================================================================
# 4. Method Resolution Order (MRO)
#=================================================================================

# Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes.
# When a method is called on an object, Python first looks in the object's class for the method, then proceeds to 
# search through the parent classes following the MRO.
# In multiple inheritance scenarios, understanding MRO is critical to predicting which method gets called.

# Example: Let's consider a scenario where we have a class Duck inheriting from multiple classes.
# The MRO determines in which order Python will search the classes to find a method or attribute.
# Calling __mro__ on a class provides the complete MRO as a tuple of classes.

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Some generic animal sound")

class Flyable:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying in the sky")

class Swimmable:
    def swim(self):
        print("Swimming in the water")

# Duck class inherits from Animal, Flyable, and Swimmable
class Duck(Animal, Flyable, Swimmable):
    def sound(self):
        print("Quack quack")  # Duck-specific implementation of sound

# We can now inspect the MRO for the Duck class
print(Duck.__mro__)
# Output: (<class '__main__.Duck'>, <class '__main__.Animal'>, <class '__main__.Flyable'>,
#          <class '__main__.Swimmable'>, <class 'object'>)

# Here, the output shows the MRO:
# 1. Duck class itself
# 2. Animal class (first parent class in the inheritance order)
# 3. Flyable class (next parent class in the inheritance chain)
# 4. Swimmable class (the last parent class in the order)
# 5. Finally, the built-in 'object' class, which is the base class for all Python classes.

# Understanding MRO is especially important in complex inheritance structures, 
# such as when multiple classes define the same method (e.g., 'sound' method). 
# Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO and ensure a deterministic resolution path.

# Example: Calling methods on a Duck object
duck = Duck()
duck.sound()  # Output: Quack quack
# In this case, the 'sound' method in the Duck class is called because Duck overrides the 'sound' method 
# inherited from the Animal class.

# MRO in action:
# If the 'sound' method were not defined in the Duck class, the method in the Animal class would be called, 
# since Animal is next in the MRO for Duck.
# Similarly, if the 'fly' method is called, Python will look in the Duck class, 
# then move to Flyable (as it's further in the MRO), and call it from there.

# Tip: When dealing with multiple inheritance, it's crucial to understand the MRO to avoid unexpected behavior.
# The 'super()' function can also leverage the MRO to allow cooperative multiple inheritance,
# ensuring that methods from all base classes are called in the correct order.

# Advanced tip: 
# The MRO can help in debugging and optimizing inheritance chains.
# By calling '__mro__', you can see the exact order Python will follow to resolve methods, 
# ensuring that method calls resolve as expected and avoiding potential inheritance conflicts.

# Potential pitfalls:
# 1. Unintended method overrides: If two parent classes define a method with the same name, 
# the method resolution will follow the MRO, potentially calling a method from an unexpected class.
# 2. Complex hierarchies: In deep or wide inheritance hierarchies, the MRO can become difficult to predict without 
# careful planning. Overusing multiple inheritance can create hard-to-maintain code, so it's best used judiciously.
# 
# As a best practice, use tools like 'print(class.__mro__)' and 'super()' to manage method resolution effectively,
# and favor composition over inheritance in complex systems to reduce potential confusion.

#=================================================================================
# 5. Encapsulation
#=================================================================================

# Encapsulation is a fundamental OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concept
# that restricts access to some of an object's components, meaning the internal state of the object is hidden from the outside.
# This prevents direct modification, which helps in maintaining data integrity and enforcing controlled access.

# In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using single or double underscores
# to indicate the protection level of attributes.

# Example of encapsulation using a 'BankAccount' class.

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        # A single underscore before the attribute name marks it as "protected"
        # This signals that the attribute is intended to be used only within the class and subclasses, 
        # though Python doesn't strictly enforce this. It's more of a convention.
        self._balance = balance  # Protected attribute: '_balance'
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        # The deposit method adds money to the account.
        # A basic check ensures that the amount to be deposited is positive.
        if amount > 0:  # Validate that the deposit amount is positive
            self._balance += amount  # Update the balance by adding the deposit amount
            return True  # Return True to indicate a successful deposit
        return False  # Return False for invalid deposit attempts (e.g., negative amounts)

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        # The withdraw method allows money to be withdrawn from the account.
        # It checks that the amount is positive and does not exceed the available balance.
        if 0 < amount <= self._balance:  # Validate that the withdrawal is within the balance
            self._balance -= amount  # Update the balance by deducting the withdrawal amount
            return True  # Return True to indicate a successful withdrawal
        return False  # Return False if the withdrawal amount is invalid or exceeds the balance

    def get_balance(self):
        # A public method to safely access the protected '_balance' attribute.
        # This method provides controlled access to the balance, following encapsulation principles.
        return self._balance  # Return the current balance of the account

# Creating an instance of the BankAccount class with an initial balance of 1000
account = BankAccount(1000)

# Depositing 500 into the account
account.deposit(500)

# Withdrawing 200 from the account
account.withdraw(200)

# Printing the current balance after deposit and withdrawal
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300

# The current balance is 1300 because:
# Initial balance = 1000
# After deposit of 500, balance = 1500
# After withdrawal of 200, balance = 1300

# Tip: Use a single underscore (_) for protected attributes and methods.
# This signals that they are intended for internal use only, but it's just a convention.
# Python allows external access to these attributes, so developers should respect this convention.

# Advanced Tip:
# Python does not enforce strict access control like some other languages (e.g., private and public in Java).
# You can still access 'protected' and 'private' attributes from outside the class if needed, 
# but doing so violates the principle of encapsulation. 
# To denote true private attributes, use a double underscore '__', which performs name mangling.
# However, name mangling should be used cautiously and only when necessary, as it can make debugging more complex.

# Example of a private attribute (though not present in the current class):
# If you want a stricter enforcement of privacy:
# self.__balance = balance  # The attribute becomes private and not easily accessible from outside the class
# Accessing it externally would require: _ClassName__attribute_name, which is generally discouraged.

# Uncommon Insight:
# While the 'protected' and 'private' conventions in Python are not enforced, their existence allows for flexibility in testing.
# In testing frameworks (e.g., unittest or pytest), developers may choose to access these attributes directly for validation purposes.
# However, modifying protected or private attributes outside their intended scope should be avoided in production code.

# Best practice:
# Encapsulation is key for maintaining control over the state of an object. It ensures that attributes cannot be arbitrarily 
# changed from outside the class, thus preventing unpredictable behavior. Always use getter/setter methods when public access is needed.

# Pitfall:
# Be aware that Python does not provide true "private" variables like some other languages. 
# The underscore conventions are simply agreements among developers and can be broken.
# Over-relying on name mangling (with double underscores) can make code harder to maintain.

#=================================================================================
# 6. Properties
#=================================================================================

# The @property decorator in Python allows you to define methods that behave like attributes.
# It provides a clean way to add logic to attribute access without exposing the internal implementation to the user.
# This is commonly used when you want to add some validation or computed logic when getting or setting a value.

# Example: Temperature class that stores a temperature in Celsius but allows conversion to and from Fahrenheit.

class Temperature:
    # __init__ method initializes the temperature in Celsius
    # The underscore prefix (i.e., _celsius) indicates that this attribute should be treated as "private" 
    # and not directly accessed outside the class. This is a convention in Python.
    def __init__(self, celsius):
        self._celsius = celsius  # Initializes the temperature value in Celsius

    # Using the @property decorator, we define a getter for 'celsius' so that users can retrieve the value of '_celsius'
    # The @property makes 'celsius' act like an attribute even though it's actually a method
    @property
    def celsius(self):
        return self._celsius  # Returns the private '_celsius' attribute
    
    # Using the setter decorator for the 'celsius' property, we add logic to set a new value for '_celsius'
    # Here, we validate that the new temperature isn't below absolute zero (-273.15°C).
    @celsius.setter
    def celsius(self, value):
        if value < -273.15:  # Absolute zero check
            # Raise a ValueError if the input is less than absolute zero, a common validation when dealing with temperature
            raise ValueError("Temperature below absolute zero is not possible")
        self._celsius = value  # Assigns the new value to '_celsius' if validation passes

    # The 'fahrenheit' property allows the temperature to be retrieved in Fahrenheit by performing the conversion
    # This is a read-only property since there is no immediate assignment of a '_fahrenheit' attribute.
    # Instead, it derives its value from the 'celsius' property.
    @property
    def fahrenheit(self):
        # Converts the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit using the standard conversion formula
        return (self.celsius * 9/5) + 32
    
    # The setter for 'fahrenheit' allows users to set the temperature in Fahrenheit
    # When a Fahrenheit value is assigned, it's converted back to Celsius and stored in '_celsius'
    # Note that no '_fahrenheit' attribute exists; everything is stored as Celsius internally.
    @fahrenheit.setter
    def fahrenheit(self, value):
        # Converts the Fahrenheit input to Celsius and assigns it to 'celsius'
        # This triggers the validation and assignment logic within the 'celsius' setter
        self.celsius = (value - 32) * 5/9  # Conversion formula: Fahrenheit to Celsius

# Now, let's see the Temperature class in action.

# Create a new Temperature object initialized to 25°C
temp = Temperature(25)

# Access the 'celsius' property to get the temperature in Celsius
print(temp.celsius)  # Output: 25

# Access the 'fahrenheit' property to get the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit
print(temp.fahrenheit)  # Output: 77.0 (25°C converted to Fahrenheit)

# Set the temperature using Fahrenheit, which converts and updates the Celsius value internally
temp.fahrenheit = 86  # Sets the temperature to 86°F

# The 'celsius' value should now be updated based on the Fahrenheit input
print(temp.celsius)  # Output: 30.0 (86°F converted to Celsius)

# Tip: Use properties for computed attributes and to add behavior to attribute access
# Properties are useful when you need to control how an attribute is set or retrieved, such as adding validation or converting values.
# This avoids exposing internal implementation details, providing a cleaner, safer interface.

# Advanced Tip:
# - Properties allow for "lazy" attribute computation. You could compute and cache the value of an expensive calculation
#   the first time it's accessed and store it in a private variable for future requests.
# - Properties can help with backward compatibility. If you initially had a public attribute but later need to add logic,
#   you can change it to a property without modifying the external interface, avoiding breaking changes.

# Potential Pitfalls:
# - Avoid excessive use of properties where simple attributes would suffice. Properties can hide the computational cost,
#   which might surprise users if accessing an attribute incurs significant overhead.
# - Be cautious of circular logic. In this example, ensure that conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit are consistent,
#   and there is no infinite recursion between the property setters.

#=================================================================================
# 7. Class and Static Methods
#=================================================================================

# In Python, class methods and static methods provide different ways to define methods that aren't instance-specific.
# They allow flexibility in how methods interact with class data, or perform tasks that aren't tied to instances at all.
# Below is an example using both types.

class MathOperations:
    # Static Method:
    # Static methods do not depend on class or instance variables.
    # They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and can be called directly on the class.
    # Use them for utility functions that don't need to know about class or instance-level data.
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        # Simple static method that adds two numbers and returns the result.
        return x + y

    # Class Method:
    # Class methods can access class-level data, but not instance-specific data.
    # They are defined using the @classmethod decorator and receive the class itself (cls) as their first argument.
    # Class methods are often used for alternative constructors or when you need to modify class-level behavior.
    @classmethod
    def multiply(cls, x, y):
        # In this example, the class method is using the static method `add` to perform part of its computation.
        # The `cls.add(x, 0)` call adds x and 0 (which doesn't change the value of x) before multiplying by y.
        # This demonstrates how class methods can call other methods within the class.
        return cls.add(x, 0) * y  # Uses the static method 'add' to return x * y

# Examples of using the static and class methods:

# Calling the static method 'add' directly from the class.
# Since 'add' is a static method, it doesn't need an instance of the class to work.
# It's called using the class name, MathOperations, and passed two arguments: 5 and 3.
print(MathOperations.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8

# Calling the class method 'multiply' directly from the class.
# The 'multiply' method uses the static 'add' method internally to calculate part of the result.
# Here, multiply(4, 3) will result in 4 * 3, which gives 12.
print(MathOperations.multiply(4, 3))  # Output: 12

#=================================================================================
# Explanation:
#=================================================================================

# Static methods:
# - Defined with @staticmethod.
# - They do not take a reference to either the class (cls) or an instance (self).
# - They are essentially normal functions that live within a class namespace, used for utility functions.
# - Static methods cannot modify the class or instance state. They are isolated from any class-related data or behavior.

# Example use case for static methods:
# - You might use static methods when you need a utility function related to the class, but it doesn't need to access
#   any class or instance variables. Examples include simple mathematical operations, data formatting functions, etc.

# Class methods:
# - Defined with @classmethod.
# - They take a reference to the class (cls) as the first argument, rather than a reference to an instance (self).
# - This allows class methods to interact with class variables or call other class-level methods.
# - Class methods are often used when you need to alter or initialize class-specific behavior.

# Example use case for class methods:
# - Class methods are particularly useful for creating alternative constructors or factory methods.
#   For instance, if you want to define multiple ways to create an instance of a class, you can use class methods to
#   provide different initialization options.

# Advanced insight:
# - Static methods can be considered as belonging more to the class itself than to its instances.
#   While they live in the class's namespace, they could technically be independent of the class. 
#   A key difference is their placement within the class, making it clear they are related conceptually to the class.

# - Class methods, on the other hand, always maintain a connection with the class itself. 
#   When subclassing, class methods automatically receive the class of the subclass, allowing for easy extension 
#   of behaviors. Static methods, however, remain bound to the class they were defined in, not the subclass.

# Pitfall:
# - One common mistake is confusing static methods with class methods. Remember, class methods take 'cls' as an argument
#   and are used when you need access to class-level data or methods. Static methods, however, don't need to know anything
#   about the class at all.
# - Another pitfall is overusing static methods where a class method might be more appropriate, especially when you 
#   expect the method to interact with the class itself, such as in scenarios involving inheritance or needing to access class-specific behavior.

#=================================================================================
# 8. Abstract Base Classes
#=================================================================================

# Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python allow you to define abstract classes, 
# which are classes that cannot be instantiated directly and are intended to be inherited.
# They are used to define a blueprint (interface) for subclasses to implement specific methods.
# Abstract methods defined in an ABC must be overridden in any concrete subclass.
# ABCs enforce the structure of the subclass, ensuring certain methods exist, improving code reliability.

# Importing ABC and abstractmethod from the abc module
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Example 1: Defining an Abstract Base Class (Shape)
class Shape(ABC):  # Shape class inherits from ABC, marking it as an abstract class
    # The @abstractmethod decorator marks this method as abstract, meaning
    # any subclass must provide its own implementation of this method.
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass  # Abstract method has no implementation, it's a placeholder
    
    # Another abstract method that subclasses must implement
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass  # Again, no implementation, subclasses will define this

# At this point, we cannot create an instance of Shape, as it contains abstract methods that
# need to be implemented by a subclass. Instantiating Shape directly would raise a TypeError.

# Example 2: Concrete subclass (Rectangle) implementing the abstract methods
# Rectangle inherits from Shape and must implement both 'area' and 'perimeter' methods
class Rectangle(Shape):
    # The constructor (__init__) method initializes width and height for the rectangle
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    # Implementation of the abstract method 'area'
    # It calculates and returns the area of the rectangle
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height  # Area is width * height for rectangles
    
    # Implementation of the abstract method 'perimeter'
    # It calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)  # Perimeter is 2 * (width + height)

# Uncommenting the following line would raise a TypeError because you can't instantiate an abstract class:
# shape = Shape()  # This would raise TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Shape with abstract methods area, perimeter

# Example usage: Creating a Rectangle object
rect = Rectangle(5, 3)  # Rectangle with width 5 and height 3

# Calling the 'area' method on the Rectangle instance
print(rect.area())  # Output: 15, since 5 * 3 = 15

# Calling the 'perimeter' method on the Rectangle instance
print(rect.perimeter())  # Output: 16, since 2 * (5 + 3) = 16

# Tip: Abstract Base Classes are particularly useful in larger applications where
# you want to ensure that certain methods are present in all subclasses that extend a base class.

# Advanced Tip:
# ABCs are often used to enforce method implementation across multiple subclasses, 
# making the code more maintainable and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors due to missing methods.
# Additionally, abstract base classes can have regular methods (i.e., methods that are implemented in the base class), 
# allowing you to provide common functionality while still enforcing certain method signatures in derived classes.

# Use case:
# ABCs are commonly used in scenarios involving multiple concrete classes that share 
# the same interface, such as shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle), database connectors, or file handlers.
# They enforce method consistency across different implementations, which is useful when working with 
# complex systems, frameworks, or large teams.

# Potential Pitfall:
# Be mindful that abstract methods do not have any implementation in the base class, so if the subclass 
# does not provide an implementation, Python will raise a TypeError at runtime.
# Abstract base classes are not commonly needed for small-scale projects, but they add value when designing 
# for scalability or enforcing design patterns like interfaces in larger codebases.

#=================================================================================
# 9. Method Overriding and Super()
#=================================================================================

# In object-oriented programming (OOP), method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific 
# implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.
# This enables polymorphic behavior, where different subclasses can define different behaviors for the same method.
# The 'super()' function is used to access methods from the parent class, promoting code reuse and preventing duplication.

# Example 1: Defining a base class (Animal) and a subclass (Dog) that overrides the 'speak' method

class Animal:
    # The constructor method (__init__) initializes the 'name' attribute for every Animal instance
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # The 'speak' method provides a generic behavior for all animals
    # This method will be overridden in subclasses to provide specific behavior
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

# Example 2: Defining a subclass (Dog) that inherits from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    # The Dog class has its own constructor (__init__) that accepts 'name' and 'breed'
    # The 'super()' function is used to call the parent class's constructor (__init__) to initialize the 'name' attribute
    # This prevents code duplication since we don't need to reimplement initialization logic for 'name'
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)  # Call the parent class's __init__ to handle the 'name' attribute
        self.breed = breed  # 'breed' is unique to the Dog class, so we initialize it here

    # The Dog class overrides the 'speak' method from the Animal class
    # Instead of the generic message, this provides a specific implementation for dogs
    def speak(self):
        # Return a string where the dog's name is followed by 'barks'
        # This replaces the behavior defined in the Animal class
        return f"{self.name} barks"

# Creating an instance of the Dog class, providing both 'name' and 'breed' arguments
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")

# When we call dog.speak(), the 'speak' method in the Dog class is invoked, not the one in the Animal class
# This demonstrates method overriding, as Dog class provides a more specific version of the 'speak' method
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy barks

# Output Explanation: 
# Even though the Dog class inherits from Animal, the overridden 'speak' method in Dog is used.
# If 'super().speak()' were called within the Dog's 'speak' method, the parent class (Animal)'s method would be invoked.

# Use case:
# Method overriding is useful when you have a base class that defines default behavior 
# but expect subclasses to provide their own specific implementations.
# For example, you can create different animal subclasses (e.g., Cat, Bird) that override 'speak' with different sounds.

# Advanced tip:
# The 'super()' function is more than just calling the parent class. It can be used in complex class hierarchies with multiple inheritance.
# Python's method resolution order (MRO) ensures that 'super()' calls the next class in the hierarchy based on the MRO, 
# which is determined by the class's inheritance order.
# To inspect the MRO of a class, you can use the __mro__ attribute or the built-in 'mro()' method:
#    print(Dog.mro())  # Shows the order in which Python looks for methods.

# Super provides a way to extend or modify the behavior of the parent class's method while still keeping the logic of the parent intact.
# This is particularly powerful when combined with method overriding in more complex inheritance structures.
# However, overusing method overriding without careful thought can lead to hard-to-maintain code,
# especially when there are deep inheritance chains.

# Potential pitfalls:
# 1. Forgetting to call 'super()' in the subclass's constructor (__init__) can result in missing initialization logic from the parent class.
# 2. When overriding methods, it's important to ensure the method signature (i.e., the number and type of arguments) matches 
#    that of the parent method, unless you're intentionally changing the behavior.
# 3. Misusing 'super()' in multiple inheritance hierarchies can lead to subtle bugs if the MRO is not clearly understood.
#    In cases of multiple inheritance, take extra care to design your class hierarchy thoughtfully to avoid complications.

#=================================================================================
# 10. Composition
#=================================================================================

# Composition is a design principle where one class contains an instance of another class.
# It allows you to build complex functionality by combining simpler, self-contained components (objects).
# In this example, a Car object contains an Engine object, and it delegates the responsibility of starting
# the engine to the Engine class.

# Example 1: Defining an Engine class
class Engine:
    # The Engine class has a 'start' method that simply returns a string when the engine is started.
    def start(self):
        return "Engine started"  # This method simulates the action of starting an engine.

# Example 2: Defining a Car class that uses an Engine object
class Car:
    # The Car class uses composition to include an Engine object inside it.
    def __init__(self):
        # The Car class has an instance of the Engine class. This is composition in action.
        # The Car does not inherit from Engine, but instead, it has an Engine as part of its attributes.
        self.engine = Engine()  # A Car object "has an" Engine object.

    # The start method in the Car class calls the start method of the Engine class.
    def start(self):
        # When the car is started, it calls its own start method, which in turn calls the Engine's start method.
        # This demonstrates delegation of functionality: the Car relies on the Engine's behavior for starting.
        return f"Car starting: {self.engine.start()}"  # Using f-string to format output with Engine's start method result.

# Creating an instance of the Car class
car = Car()  # This creates a Car object, which also creates an Engine object as part of the Car.
# Printing the result of starting the Car, which starts the Engine as well
print(car.start())  # Output: Car starting: Engine started
# This output shows that the Car successfully starts its Engine through composition.

# Key insight: 
# In composition, the Car class doesn't inherit from the Engine class, but it "contains" an Engine object.
# This allows the Car to delegate the responsibility of starting the engine to the Engine object.
# It's a "has-a" relationship (Car has an Engine), rather than "is-a" (Car is an Engine), making the design more flexible.

# Advanced tip:
# Composition is often preferred over inheritance, especially in scenarios where multiple classes need similar functionality
# but aren't logically in the same family of objects. For example, a "Plane" may also have an "Engine," but it wouldn't make sense
# for Plane and Car to inherit from the same "Vehicle" class if their behaviors diverge significantly.
# Composition enables code reuse without the tight coupling that inheritance can cause.

# Use case:
# In a more advanced case, imagine extending the Car class to include other components like "Transmission" or "Battery."
# Each of these components can be added as objects, each with its own behavior, allowing flexible and modular design
# without altering the Car class significantly. This aligns well with SOLID principles, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle,
# where each class manages only its specific functionality (e.g., Engine handles engine-related tasks).

# Best practice:
# When a class requires functionality that another class provides, but they don't share a strong hierarchical relationship,
# composition is the best choice. This reduces coupling, increases flexibility, and allows you to modify or extend behaviors
# by changing the internal objects without affecting the public interface of the containing class.

# Potential pitfalls:
# Composition increases the number of objects that need to be managed, especially in large systems.
# However, it's a better option for most real-world scenarios than deep inheritance trees, which can make code rigid and difficult to maintain.
# The complexity in composition can be mitigated by clear, well-defined responsibilities for each component class.

#=================================================================================
# 11. Mixins
#=================================================================================

# A "Mixin" is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming to add reusable methods 
# or attributes to classes without using full inheritance. This allows for more modular, 
# flexible, and reusable code, as a class can inherit behavior from multiple mixins while 
# maintaining a simpler class hierarchy. The mixin itself is not intended to be instantiated 
# on its own, but rather mixed into other classes.

# Example 1: Basic Mixin Usage

import json  # Importing json module for serialization

class SerializeMixin:
    # This mixin provides serialization functionality for classes that inherit it
    def serialize(self):
        # The 'serialize' method converts an object's dictionary (attributes) into a JSON string
        return json.dumps(self.__dict__)  # __dict__ returns the instance's attributes in dictionary form

# The Person class inherits from the SerializeMixin to add serialization behavior
class Person(SerializeMixin):
    # The initializer method creates attributes 'name' and 'age' for instances of Person
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Setting the 'name' attribute of the instance
        self.age = age    # Setting the 'age' attribute of the instance

# Creating an instance of Person
person = Person("Alice", 30)

# Since Person inherits from SerializeMixin, it has access to the serialize method
# The serialize method will return the dictionary of the 'person' object as a JSON string
print(person.serialize())  # Output: {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Output explanation:
# The 'serialize' method returns a JSON representation of the 'person' object.
# The __dict__ method allows for easy access to all instance variables of an object,
# which are then converted into a JSON string using json.dumps.

# Use case:
# Mixins like 'SerializeMixin' are ideal for adding functionality such as serialization, 
# logging, or other cross-cutting concerns to multiple unrelated classes. This avoids deep inheritance chains.

# Example 2: Combining multiple mixins
# You can combine multiple mixins to add several independent behaviors to a class.
# For instance, we can add a mixin for logging functionality.

class LogMixin:
    # A simple mixin to log information
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"LOG: {message}")

# Person class now inherits from both SerializeMixin and LogMixin
class Employee(Person, LogMixin):
    def __init__(self, name, age, employee_id):
        # Calling the initializer of the parent class (Person) to reuse its logic
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.employee_id = employee_id  # Adding a new attribute specific to Employee

# Creating an instance of Employee
employee = Employee("Bob", 25, "E12345")

# The Employee class now has both serialization and logging behaviors
print(employee.serialize())  # Output: {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "employee_id": "E12345"}
employee.log("Employee created")  # Output: LOG: Employee created

# Use case:
# This pattern allows a class to mix in independent functionalities (like logging and serialization) 
# without being constrained by traditional inheritance limitations. It's particularly useful when 
# multiple behaviors are needed across different classes that do not share a direct inheritance relationship.

# Advanced tip:
# A common issue with multiple inheritance is the complexity of method resolution order (MRO), 
# especially when two mixins or parent classes define the same method. Python resolves this through 
# the C3 linearization algorithm, ensuring a consistent order for method lookup. You can inspect 
# the MRO of a class using `ClassName.__mro__` or the `mro()` method, which is valuable for debugging 
# in complex inheritance structures.

# Potential pitfalls:
# - Mixins should not contain state (i.e., instance variables) unless it’s absolutely necessary. 
#   If mixins manage state, it can lead to unintended side effects, making the code harder to maintain.
#   Ideally, mixins are stateless and only provide reusable methods.
# - Excessive use of mixins can lead to a "mixins soup," where the class hierarchy becomes confusing, 
#   making the code less readable and maintainable. A clean, well-thought-out design is crucial.
# - Always consider whether using a mixin is the most appropriate design choice. In some cases, 
#   composition (i.e., injecting functionality via delegation) can be more flexible than mixins.

# Best practice:
# Limit mixins to adding behaviors and utility methods, and avoid adding too much functionality 
# that can obscure the intent of the base class. Keep them single-purpose to maintain clarity and simplicity.

#=================================================================================
# 12. Dataclasses (Python 3.7+)
#=================================================================================

# Dataclasses are a feature introduced in Python 3.7 that simplifies the creation of classes 
# intended to store data. They automatically generate special methods like __init__, __repr__, 
# __eq__, and __hash__, which makes them ideal for creating lightweight classes.
# This is particularly useful for classes that are primarily used to store attributes without 
# needing a lot of boilerplate code.

# Importing the dataclass decorator from the dataclasses module
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Example: Defining a simple dataclass to represent a point in 2D space
@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float  # x-coordinate of the point
    y: float  # y-coordinate of the point

    # Method to calculate the distance from the origin (0, 0) using the Pythagorean theorem
    def distance_from_origin(self):
        # Calculating the distance from the origin
        # The expression (self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2) ** 0.5 computes the square root of the sum of squares
        return (self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2) ** 0.5

# Creating an instance of Point with x = 3 and y = 4
p = Point(3, 4)

# Printing the Point instance
# The __repr__ method is automatically generated, providing a clear string representation of the object
print(p)  # Output: Point(x=3, y=4)

# Calling the method to compute the distance from the origin
print(p.distance_from_origin())  # Output: 5.0

# Use case:
# Dataclasses are particularly useful in situations where you need to represent simple data structures,
# such as points, records, or configurations, where readability and simplicity are essential.
# They help maintain clean code without excessive boilerplate for class methods.

# Advanced tip:
# Dataclasses can also support default values, default factory functions for mutable types, 
# and field customization through the `field()` function.
# You can specify `frozen=True` in the dataclass decorator to make instances immutable, 
# which is useful for hashable data types.

# Example of using default values and frozen instances
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Circle:
    radius: float = 1.0  # Default radius value
    center: Point = Point(0, 0)  # Default center point at the origin

# Attempting to change the radius will raise a FrozenInstanceError
# circle = Circle(5)
# circle.radius = 10  # This would raise an error

# Potential pitfalls:
# While dataclasses are convenient, be aware of mutable default arguments (like lists or dictionaries).
# It's best practice to use `field(default_factory=list)` or similar for mutable defaults to avoid shared references.
# Additionally, ensure clarity in your data model, as using complex types can obscure the simplicity that dataclasses provide.

#=================================================================================
# 13. Type Hints in Classes (Python 3.5+)
#=================================================================================

# Type hints in Python (introduced in Python 3.5) allow developers to specify the expected data types of variables, 
# function parameters, and return values. This enhances code readability and aids in debugging 
# by providing clear expectations for what types of data are to be used, which is particularly beneficial 
# in larger codebases and collaborative environments.

# Importing List from the typing module allows us to specify that a variable will be a list of a specific type.
from typing import List

# Example class definition: ShoppingCart
class ShoppingCart:
    # Constructor method to initialize the ShoppingCart instance
    def __init__(self) -> None:  # Indicates that this method does not return any value
        # Initializing items as a list that will hold strings (item names)
        self.items: List[str] = []  # Using type hints to specify that 'items' is a list of strings

    # Method to add an item to the shopping cart
    def add_item(self, item: str) -> None:  # 'item' is expected to be a string
        # Appending the item to the items list
        self.items.append(item)

    # Method to retrieve the list of items in the shopping cart
    def get_items(self) -> List[str]:  # This method returns a list of strings
        return self.items  # Returning the current list of items

# Creating an instance of ShoppingCart
cart = ShoppingCart()
# Adding an item to the shopping cart
cart.add_item("Apple")
# Retrieving and printing the list of items in the cart
print(cart.get_items())  # Output: ['Apple']

# Output: The output shows that the item "Apple" has been successfully added to the shopping cart.

# Advanced tip: 
# Using type hints facilitates better tooling support, such as static type checkers (e.g., mypy) 
# and integrated development environment (IDE) features (e.g., autocomplete and type checking).
# It promotes self-documenting code, where the purpose of each method and variable type is explicitly stated,
# reducing the learning curve for new developers and improving overall code maintainability.

# Potential pitfalls:
# While type hints enhance clarity, they do not enforce type checking at runtime, 
# meaning incorrect types can still be passed without raising an error. 
# Developers should be cautious not to rely solely on type hints for input validation and should 
# still implement necessary runtime checks where appropriate.
# Additionally, excessive or inconsistent use of type hints can lead to code clutter. 
# It's essential to maintain a balance and prioritize readability.

#=================================================================================
# 14. Descriptors
#=================================================================================

# Descriptors in Python are a powerful feature that allows you to customize the behavior 
# of attribute access (getting, setting, deleting) in classes. They provide a way to 
# define reusable property-like behaviors that can be shared across multiple classes.

# Example 1: Descriptor class for positive values
# The Positive class acts as a descriptor that enforces that any value set 
# through it must be positive.

class Positive:
    # __set_name__ is called when the descriptor is created
    # It allows the descriptor to know the name of the attribute it is assigned to
    def __set_name__(self, owner, name):
        self.name = name  # Store the name of the attribute for later use

    # __get__ is called to retrieve the value of the attribute
    # 'obj' is the instance from which we want to get the attribute value
    def __get__(self, obj, objtype=None):
        return obj.__dict__[self.name]  # Return the value stored in the instance's __dict__

    # __set__ is called to set the value of the attribute
    def __set__(self, obj, value):
        # Check if the value is less than or equal to zero
        if value <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Value must be positive")  # Raise an error if the value is invalid
        obj.__dict__[self.name] = value  # Store the value in the instance's __dict__

# Example 2: Using the descriptor in a class
# The Product class uses the Positive descriptor for its attributes.
class Product:
    # Both price and quantity are defined as Positive descriptors
    price = Positive()  # Descriptor for price attribute
    quantity = Positive()  # Descriptor for quantity attribute

    # Constructor for initializing the Product object
    def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):
        self.name = name  # Set the name attribute
        self.price = price  # Set the price using the Positive descriptor
        self.quantity = quantity  # Set the quantity using the Positive descriptor

# Creating an instance of Product
product = Product("Apple", 0.5, 10)  # Valid initialization

# Example of error handling
# Uncommenting the next line will raise a ValueError since -1 is not a valid price
# product.price = -1  # This would raise ValueError: Value must be positive

# Output: If you try to set a negative price, a ValueError is raised, demonstrating 
# the enforcement of positive values for price and quantity.

# Tip: Use descriptors for reusable property-like behaviors across multiple classes
# This pattern is especially useful in scenarios where multiple classes require similar
# validation logic. Descriptors help encapsulate this logic, promoting code reuse 
# and separation of concerns.

# Advanced insight:
# Descriptors can also manage more complex behaviors, such as lazy loading, 
# computed properties, or type checking, by extending the __get__ and __set__ methods.
# You can implement caching mechanisms within a descriptor to optimize performance 
# in resource-intensive scenarios or maintain state across multiple attribute accesses.

# Potential pitfalls:
# It's essential to understand the lifecycle of descriptors, particularly the 
# relationship between the descriptor and its owner class. Descriptors are not bound 
# to instances but to the class itself, which can lead to unexpected behaviors if 
# not carefully managed. Ensure you understand how attribute access works to avoid 
# confusion.

#=================================================================================
# 15. Context Managers
#=================================================================================

# Context managers in Python provide a convenient way to manage resources, ensuring proper allocation and cleanup.
# They allow setup and teardown actions to be executed automatically when entering and exiting a context.
# This is particularly useful for managing resources such as database connections, file handling, and network sockets.

# The context manager is defined using a class with __enter__ and __exit__ methods.

class DatabaseConnection:
    # The __enter__ method is executed when the execution flow enters the context of the with statement.
    # It is responsible for initializing the resource (e.g., opening a database connection).
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Connecting to database")  # Simulate connecting to the database
        return self  # Return the instance of the class to be used in the context

    # The __exit__ method is executed when the execution flow exits the context.
    # It handles cleanup actions (e.g., closing the database connection).
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Closing database connection")  # Simulate closing the database connection
        # The parameters exc_type, exc_value, and traceback allow handling exceptions
        # Here, we don't need to handle them, so we can simply pass.

    # A method for executing SQL queries
    def query(self, sql):
        print(f"Executing SQL: {sql}")  # Simulate executing a SQL query

# Using the context manager with the 'with' statement
# The 'with' statement ensures that __enter__ is called before the block executes,
# and __exit__ is called afterward, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
with DatabaseConnection() as db:
    db.query("SELECT * FROM users")  # Within this block, the database connection is active

# Output:
# Connecting to database
# Executing SQL: SELECT * FROM users
# Closing database connection

# Tip:
# Use context managers to ensure resources are managed properly, 
# preventing resource leaks and ensuring that cleanup occurs even if an error is encountered.
# This is especially important in scenarios involving external resources like files and network connections,
# where failure to close or release the resource can lead to data loss or corruption.

# Advanced tip:
# You can also use the contextlib module's contextmanager decorator to create context managers using generator functions.
# This can simplify context manager creation, making your code cleaner and easier to read.
# Example of a generator-based context manager:

from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def open_file(file_name):
    try:
        f = open(file_name, 'r')  # Open the file
        yield f  # Yield the file object to be used within the context
    finally:
        f.close()  # Ensure the file is closed after the block

# Example usage of the generator-based context manager
with open_file("example.txt") as f:
    content = f.read()  # Read the file contents
    print(content)

# Potential pitfalls:
# Ensure the __exit__ method properly handles any exceptions raised in the context block.
# Failing to do so may result in unclosed resources and can mask the original exception.
# Additionally, avoid performing long-running operations within the context manager's __enter__ or __exit__ methods,
# as this can block other operations and degrade performance.

#=================================================================================
# 16. Metaclasses
#=================================================================================

# Metaclasses in Python are a deep and powerful feature that allows you to define how 
# classes behave. A metaclass is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves.
# The most common use case for metaclasses is to control class creation and provide 
# class-level attributes and methods.

# Example: Singleton Pattern using Metaclass
# The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides 
# a global point of access to it. This is achieved by using a metaclass.

class SingletonMeta(type):
    # Class variable to hold instances of classes that use this metaclass
    _instances = {}

    # This method is called when an instance of the class is created.
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        # Check if an instance of this class already exists
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            # If not, create a new instance and store it in the _instances dictionary
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Return the stored instance, ensuring only one instance is ever created
        return cls._instances[cls]

# Defining a class that uses SingletonMeta as its metaclass
class Singleton(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None  # Initializing a class attribute

# Testing the Singleton pattern
s1 = Singleton()  # First instance creation
s2 = Singleton()  # Second instance creation, but it will return the same instance as s1
print(s1 is s2)  # Output: True, confirming both variables refer to the same instance

# Use case:
# The Singleton pattern is useful in scenarios where a single instance is needed to 
# coordinate actions across the system, such as logging or database connections.

# Advanced tip:
# Use metaclasses to enforce design patterns or to implement automatic attribute registration.
# For example, you can use a metaclass to ensure that all attributes of a class are defined in a certain way 
# or to automatically add utility methods to all instances.

# Potential pitfalls:
# Metaclasses can introduce significant complexity into your code. They are not widely used,
# and when they are, they can make the code harder to read and maintain.
# It's crucial to document the purpose and behavior of any metaclass thoroughly. 
# Use metaclasses sparingly and only when the benefits of their capabilities outweigh the potential 
# downsides of increased complexity. For many scenarios, decorators or simple inheritance will suffice.

# 17. Best Practices and Tips
#=================================================================================

# In this section, we outline best practices for class design and implementation in Python.
# Adhering to these principles enhances code maintainability, readability, and overall structure.

# 1. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
# Each class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
# This helps in reducing the impact of changes and makes the code easier to test.
class UserProfile:
    # This class handles user profile information exclusively
    def __init__(self, username, email):
        self.username = username
        self.email = email

# 2. Use inheritance sparingly; prefer composition when possible.
# Inheritance can lead to tightly coupled code. Composition allows for more flexibility.
class Engine:
    # Represents an engine that can be composed into different vehicles
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine: Engine):
        self.engine = engine  # Composition: Car has an engine

# 3. Keep your classes small and focused.
# Smaller classes are easier to understand, test, and maintain.
class OrderProcessor:
    def process_order(self, order):
        # Implementation for processing an order
        pass

# 4. Use properties instead of getter and setter methods.
# Properties provide a clean way to manage attribute access and encapsulation.
class Product:
    def __init__(self, price):
        self._price = price  # Private attribute

    @property
    def price(self):
        return self._price

    @price.setter
    def price(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative")
        self._price = value

# 5. Use abstract base classes to define interfaces.
# Abstract base classes (ABCs) help in defining a clear interface for subclasses.
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

# 6. Understand and use method resolution order (MRO) in multiple inheritance.
# MRO determines the order in which classes are searched when executing a method.
class A:
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from A"

class B(A):
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from B"

class C(A):
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from C"

class D(B, C):
    pass

# The order of method resolution is B -> C -> A
# print(D().greet())  # Outputs: Hello from B

# 7. Use staticmethod and classmethod decorators appropriately.
# Use @staticmethod for utility functions that don't access class or instance data.
# Use @classmethod for factory methods or when needing access to class-level data.
class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

    @classmethod
    def from_tuple(cls, data):
        return cls(data[0], data[1])  # Factory method example

# 8. Leverage dataclasses for simple data structures.
# Dataclasses automatically generate special methods for classes with primarily data attributes.
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    username: str
    email: str

# 9. Use type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.
# Type hints clarify the expected types for function arguments and return values.
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

# 10. Implement special methods (__str__, __repr__, etc.) for better object representation.
# Special methods enhance the usability of class instances in built-in functions and operations.
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person named {self.name}"

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Person({self.name!r})"  # Includes the string representation of name

# 11. Use context managers for resource management.
# Context managers handle setup and teardown operations cleanly.
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, World!')  # File is automatically closed after this block

# 12. Be cautious with multiple inheritance and understand its implications.
# Multiple inheritance can lead to complexity and ambiguity (the diamond problem).
# Always consider using composition as an alternative.

# 13. Use descriptors for reusable attribute management.
# Descriptors allow you to define custom behavior for getting, setting, or deleting an attribute.
class Descriptor:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        return "Descriptor value"

class MyClass:
    attribute = Descriptor()  # Using a descriptor

# 14. Understand the difference between class and instance attributes.
# Class attributes are shared across instances, while instance attributes are unique to each instance.
class Example:
    class_attr = 0  # Class attribute shared by all instances

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.instance_attr = value  # Unique to each instance

# 15. Use metaclasses judiciously, as they can add significant complexity.
# Metaclasses define the behavior of classes, which can be powerful but lead to intricate designs.
class Meta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
    pass
